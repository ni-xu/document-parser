Pine Grove under boil advisory

Jan. 11--PINE GROVE -- A water main break that occurred Sunday in nearby Ravine is being blamed for a boil advisory for all Pine Grove water customers.
According to Margaret C. Davenport, Pine Grove Borough secretary/treasurer, the pipe broke sometime Sunday near Route 125 and Mollystown Road. The road was closed from the intersection to the borough Sunday while a seven-foot section of pipe was replaced.
Davenport said work was finished at 2:30 a.m. today and the road was reopened this morning.
The boil advisory will be in effect for at least three days or until results of water samples are returned with a clear reading. A drop or loss of water pressure could cause contaminants to enter the distributions system, and there is an increased chance that the water may include disease-causing organisms.
The Pine Grove Water Department urges customers to bring water to a rolling boil, let it boil for one minute and cool before using. Otherwise use bottled water.
Customers should use boiled or bottled water for drinking, making ice, washing dishes, brushing teeth and food preparation until further notice.
The water main is not part of the more than $2 million borough water project that includes well remediation, repair and painting of the water storage tanks, replacing several water lines and replacing some meters.
The borough council approved borrowing $2.4 million in a line of credit from Union Bank & Trust, Pottsville, at an interest rate of 3.45 percent over five years to pay for the project. The money will be repaid using anticipated PENNVEST funding.
According to borough council members, a study that began in January showed the borough had been losing up to 750,000 gallons of water per month because of breaks and leaks, many of which went previously undetected.

Jan. 11--Missouri American Water issued a boil order advisory for about 100 customers in Buchanan County on Sunday. Customers living within the boundaries of 371 Highway to the West, MM Highway to the East, H Highway to the North and Buchanan County Line to the South are affected.
The precautionary order is still in affect Monday. A company spokesperson said it should be lifted at approximately 5 p.m.
Christie Barnhart, external affairs manager for the utility company, said the order was issued due to pressure loss caused by a four-inch water main break.
Residents in those areas should bring their water to a rolling boil for five minutes before using it for drinking and cooking. Tap water is okay to use for other purposes such as bathing and washing clothes.
Customers may call the Missouri American Water 24-hour customer service center at 1-866-430-0820 for more information.

Strasburg Lifts Water Advisory

Strasburg Borough lifted its boil-water advisory Monday morning after follow-up tests of its source well turned up no traces of E. coli.
The borough had urged its residents on Friday to boil tap water through the weekend before drinking or cooking with it because a routine sample of one of its source wells had tested positive for E. coli contamination.
Similar tests of treated water in the distribution system showed there was no contamination, however, suggesting the virus hasn't made its way to homes. Only water from the source well tested positive.
The borough increased the amount of chlorine residual it uses to treat the water and conducted new tests of the well last week. The results of the tests, which came back Monday morning, showed no contamination.

BOIL WATER ADVISORY ISSUED FOR CITY OF OVERBROOK

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Overbrook, which is located in northeast Osage County.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory due to a break in a water main which has caused the water tower to drain, resulting in a loss of pressure in the distribution system. The City is actively trying to locate and isolate the leak to restore pressure. While repairs are being made, customers of the City may be without water for an extended period of time. Whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) levels are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
When water service is restored, residents served by the city of Overbrook public water system should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded.
Customers may direct questions to the Overbrook City Hall by calling (785) 665-7328.

The Mississippi Department of Health issued the following news release:
The Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reminds those affected by Jackson-area boil water alerts that as water pressure returns, the water is NOT safe to drink until the boil water advisory is lifted. MSDH will alert the public through the media, its website and Twitter when Jackson water is safe to drink again.
MSDH is working with the City of Jackson and surrounding areas to ensure public health standards are maintained. As pressure returns, MSDH will test water samples collected from water supply systems, and must have two consecutive days of clear test samples before a boil water advisory can be lifted.
Until the boil water advisory is lifted, affected residents should follow these guidelines:
* Do not drink tap water.
* Do not use ice made from recent tap water.
* Do not use tap water to make drinks, juices, or fountain soft drinks.
* Cook with tap water only if food is boiled for at least one minute.
* Wash dishes, fruits and vegetables in boiled water or water that has been disinfected with bleach.
* Brush your teeth with boiled or bottled water.
* Wash your hands and bathe as usual. Bathing is safe as long as no water is swallowed.
Take the following steps to treat water:
* Bring water to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill most organisms.
* If you cannot boil your water, mix eight drops (1/8 teaspoon) of unscented, ordinary household chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Mix the solution thoroughly, and let stand for about 30 minutes before using.

The Mississippi Department of Health issued the following news release:
The Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) stands ready to test water samples from the City of Jackson over the holiday weekend. Once the Division of Water Supply receives the water samples, testing will begin immediately.
A total of 160 samples, including both ground and surface water, will need to be tested. The number of samples required for testing is based on an established plan that includes the area and what procedures need to be followed. Water samples can be collected in the rain; however, extra precautions must be followed in order to prevent sample contamination.
The Jackson boil water advisory cannot be lifted until test results show two consecutive days of clear samples for all 160 submissions. All 1,276 water systems in Mississippi are required to regularly submit samples for testing on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on population. All tests are completed in the Mississippi State Public Health Laboratory.
MSDH reminds those affected by Jackson-area boil water alerts that as water pressure returns, the water is NOT safe to drink until the boil water advisory is lifted. MSDH will alert the public through the media, its website and Twitter when Jackson water is safe to drink again.
Until the boil water advisory is lifted, affected residents should follow these guidelines:
* Do not drink tap water.
* Do not use ice made from recent tap water.
* Do not use tap water to make drinks, juices, or fountain soft drinks.
* Cook with tap water only if food is boiled for at least one minute.
* Wash dishes, fruits and vegetables in boiled water or water that has been disinfected with bleach.
* Brush your teeth with boiled or bottled water.
* Wash your hands and bathe as usual. Bathing is safe as long as no water is swallowed.
Take the following steps to treat water:
* Bring water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute to kill most organisms.
* If you cannot boil your water, mix eight drops (1/8 teaspoon) of unscented, ordinary household chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Mix the solution thoroughly, and let stand for about 30 minutes before using.

The Mississippi Department of Health issued the following news release:

Testing remains to be completed for Jackson's well water system that serves residents in south Jackson, Byram, and other locations listed below.
From the City of Jackson's original news release:
Mayor Johnson announced during a press conference today that the Health Department reported that water samples taken from the city's surface water system were all clear. The boil water notice for the approximately 175,000 residents on the surface water system is now lifted.
The pressure on the well water system in southwest Jackson is still building and when it reaches an acceptable level, testing will begin for it. City crews expect that testing should begin Monday. Residents on that system are still on a boil water notice. Please see the details below.
WELL SYSTEM PRECAUTIONARY BOIL WATER NOTICE
A precautionary boil water advisory is still in effect until further notice for all customers on the City's well water system located in the southwestern part of the City and Hinds County. The city expects to begin pulling samples for testing Monday.
THIS ADVISORY AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 16,267 CUSTOMERS that are served by the well system. The following locations are included:
* West of Westhaven Boulevard, in addition to North Westhaven Drive, East Westhaven Drive, South Westhaven Drive, Westwood Drive and Sunnybrook Drive
* South of Interstate 20, West of Robinson Road Extension

Click for map of Jackon Well System service area (http://msdh.ms.gov/documents/JacksonWellMap.pdf)
This is a precautionary advisory. All well system customers are advised to boil their drinking water until adequate pressure is restored to the system. Water should be brought to a rolling boil for one minute for the following: cooking or baking, making ice cubes, taking medication, brushing teeth, washing food, mixing baby formula or food, mixing juices or drinks feeding pets, washing dishes and all other consumption. Water does not have to be boiled for the following activities: showering or washing clothes.
Crews will collect water samples to monitor the safety of the drinking water. It typically takes at least 24-48 hours to obtain the additional test results, so it is important for customers in the affected area to continue to boil water until further notice. Residents will be notified immediately when the advisory is lifted.

Jan. 21--OCTC board to meet at 5 tonight
The Owensboro Community & Technical College Board of Directors will receive an update on the search for a new president when it meets at 5 tonight in the administrative boardroom on the campus.
The quarterly meeting agenda also includes updates on the establishment of a Hancock County campus, the theater arts program, enrollment, student financial facts and other topics.
Deadline for election filings is Tuesday
Candidates wishing to run for office must file their papers at their county clerk's office by 4 p.m. Tuesday.
In Daviess County, the clerk's office is open until 4:30 p.m. But state law requires that all papers be filed by 4 p.m.
Richard House, deputy clerk in the Daviess County Clerk's Office, said people filing for office should make sure they have picked up the right papers. County offices are partisan races and have different paperwork than Owensboro City Commission races. City commissioners are nonpartisan.
People running for county commissioner, constable and justice of the peace must have their papers signed by two residents in their home districts. The residents must also be of the same political party as the person running for office.
House suggests candidates not wait until Tuesday to file papers. If something is wrong with a candidate's paperwork, filing before Tuesday will give the candidate time to make corrections, House said.
Water advisory lifted
The Ohio County Water District has lifted the boil-water advisory for residents living in the eastern areas of the county, including Askins, Baizetown, Breckinridge, Dundee, Falls of Rough, Horse Branch, Narrows, Olaton, Rosine and parts of Fordsville.

CARBONDALE -- A 7-year-old girl was hospitalized with burns after an attic fire in a city home on Sunday.
Crews responded just before 2:30 p.m. to a fire at 26 Maple Ave., Fire Chief Thomas Brennan said. Flames were shooting out the attic windows. Chief Brennan said the fire appears to have started in the attic.
Resident Gary Childs said he was in a second-floor apartment with six of his children when the fire started. His daughter suffered burns and was taken to the burn center at Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, he said.
Information on her condition was unavailable. No one else was injured. Crews contained the fire to the attic, and no neighboring homes were damaged, Chief Brennan said.
"We had the fire knocked down in 10 minutes," he said.
The two-unit home sustained little smoke and water damage, he said. The downstairs apartment was vacant, he said. "I would say it's fixable," the chief said of the home.
The American Red Cross of Lackawanna County is providing the rest of the family with food, clothing and lodging at a hotel, disaster services director Brian Wrightson said.
Family members were able to recover some belongings but are in need of diapers, Mr. Childs said.

Southwestern PA Power Outages Lead DEP to Issue Boil Water Advisory for Residents Experiencing Service Disruptions

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release:
The Department of Environmental Protection issued a cautionary boil water advisory today to southwestern Pennsylvania residents who have experienced a disruption in their water service as the result of widespread power outages.
The power outages were the result of heavy snowfall and have affected operations for Pennsylvania American Water, Aldrich Plant Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County and East Dunkard Water Authority. Without power, the suppliers are unable to draw and treat water from its source.
Once service is restored, water customers should boil water for one full minute before consuming water it.
Any widespread service interruption will cause a loss of pressure in water lines, which could result in bacteria entering the lines.
The suppliers alerted DEP of the issue and are now providing water from reserves. Once these reserves are depleted, customers may be without water service.
Once restored, DEP will review lab analysis of water samples taken from any system at which service is interrupted to determine when the cautionary boil water advisory can be lifted.

THE BIG DIG REGION; STRUGGLES TO REGAIN ITS FOOTING; NATIONAL GUARD CALLED; GOVERNMENT, SCHOOLS, SOME TRANSIT CLOSED; THOUSANDS STILL WITHOUT POWER

As residents throughout the region continued to dig out from the biggest snowstorm in more than 15 years, utilities battled to restore power to tens of thousands of customers and road crews worked overtime to plow roads clogged with heavy snow, slush and ice.
Gov. Ed Rendell has dispatched the National Guard to Pittsburgh and Allegheny County to assist fire, ambulance and police as public works crews continue to clear the streets of the nearly two feet of snow that fell across the region Friday and Saturday, felling hundreds of trees and pulling down electrical wires.
In Allegheny County, the number of people without power Sunday evening had been reduced to 24,000 from a high of 80,000 on Saturday, according to a news release from Allegheny County.
The Port Authority has restored limited bus service on multiple routes across Allegheny County, but buses are not running on many routes because of difficult road conditions.
The T should be up and running for morning rush hour, the Port Authority announced. Service has been restored to the Mon Incline. Riders should check www.portauthority.org for updated information.
Allegheny County and 34 municipalities have declared states of emergency.
Kevin Evanto, a county spokesman, said the disaster emergency declaration enables the county and municipalities to take all necessary actions to address storm-related issues, including bypassing standard procurement and contract procedures to hire temporary workers, rent equipment, and purchase supplies and materials.
"The declaration also positions the county and municipalities to request resources, assistance and funding from the commonwealth and federal governments if needed," Mr. Evanto said.
Allegheny County also announced that, to reduce traffic volume, only essential county government offices will be open today.
President Judge Donna Jo McDaniel has ordered the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas closed today. The order covers all divisions and departments of the court.
The court closure does not effect the 24-hour preliminary arraignment operation.
Driving conditions continue to be challenging throughout the region, and in some areas of Allegheny County, roads are still covered in snow and slush. Due to heavy snow and ice, trees and power lines have continued to fall.
The county is advising motorists to limit driving and stay off streets and roads to allow public works crews, power companies and emergency responders to do their work.
Call volumes to the Allegheny County 911 remain high -- 15,000 over the last 24 hours compared to the normal 4,000 a day. The county reminds residents to call 911 only to report emergencies.
The Allegheny County Public Works Department reported that the vast majority of county-owned roads are clear of snow and ice, but because of falling trees and downed power lines, the following roads are closed: Lougeay Road, Wilkins; Cliff Mine Road, North Fayette; Pangburn Hollow Road, Elizabeth; Glen Avenue, Shaler; and Scotia Hollow Road, Jefferson Hills.
"The road conditions are still precarious," said Jim Struzzi, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
"Everything is open now except for those roads where power lines have fallen, but even the interstates have patches of compacted snow and ice that, because of the lower temperatures, are not melting."
Baldwin Borough police Chief Michael Scott said falling trees and wires in the streets have forced the closing of Glass Run from State Route 885 to Joseph Street; Streets Run Road from Delwar Road to Brentwood Road; and the 1700 block of Prospect Street at its intersection with Streets Run Road.
"We've got some live wires down and power has been out in the north end of the borough since Saturday night," Chief Scott said. "It's been difficult to get any emergency vehicles in and out of there and we've been bringing people out one house at a time."
Duquesne Light said it had reduced the number of customers without power as of Sunday evening from a high of 57,000 to 6,400. Joseph Vallarian, a Duquesne Light spokesman, said some customers have been without power since Friday night but the company is systematically working through the outages and expects to have power restored to most customers by midnight today and to all customers by Wednesday afternoon.
Allegheny Power struggled Sunday to return power to 82,000 of its customers in Pennsylvania, including nearly 36,000 still without electricity in Washington County and almost 10,600 -- more than half of the power company's customers -- in Greene County.
Another 36,000 Allegheny Power customers were without power in West Virginia, as well as 5,800 in Virginia.
David Neurohr, an Allegheny Power spokesman, said Sunday that while electricity will be restored to most in the next 24 hours, some will be without power for an "extended period of time" and for "pockets of people it will be a multi-day event."
"The widespread nature and extent of the storm's damage has hampered the ability of our crews to get back into some very rural, very remote, and with a storm like this, very inaccessible areas," Mr. Neurohr said.
Mr. Neurohr said all of the company's line crews are out, and Allegheny Power also has also contracted with up to 1,000 outside contractors and brought in hundreds of trained crews from other utilities not hit by the storm in western Ohio and southern New York.
He said the power restoration work will be prioritized with public service buildings and hospitals getting attention first, followed by transportation systems and the largest concentrations of customers.
A mandatory water conservation order issued by Pennsylvania American Water on Saturday was lifted early Sunday, though a cautionary boil-water advisory by the state Department of Environmental Protection continued for residents in southwestern Pennsylvania who experienced a disruption in their water service stemming from the widespread power outages.
The Red Cross is operating three shelters where people can spend the night and get hearty meals. The shelters are in White Oak at the Rainbow Fire Department, 2916 Jacks Run Road; Elizabeth at the Elizabeth Forward High School, 1000 Weigles Hill Road; and Whitehall at Hamilton Presbyterian Church, 4500 Hamilton Road.
And for those who think they might take advantage of a snow day by taking in some winter sports, think again: the ice skating rinks at North and South parks are closed, as are the Boyce Park ski and snowtubing areas.

Boil Water Advisory Issued for the City of Woodston and Rooks County RWD #1

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued the following news release:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Woodston and Rooks County RWD #1 water systems, located in northeast Rooks County. Both systems serve a combined population of approximately 300 persons.
KDHE officials issued the advisory due to a major leak and subsequent repair, which caused an interruption in water service resulting in little or no water pressure. Whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) levels are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
When water service is restored, residents served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
* Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use.Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
* Use only boiled water for drinking, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
* Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
* Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
* Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested.Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release:
The Department of Environmental Protection reported today that water service disruptions persist for many customers throughout southwestern Pennsylvania as a result of last week's heavy snowstorms.
The department reminded residents that once their service is restored, they should remember to heat water to a rolling boil for one full minute initially before consuming it.
The power outages have primarily affected water suppliers' operations in Greene and Washington counties. East Dunkard Water Association is unable to provide water to customers in its outlying service area and Dunkard Valley Joint Municipal Authority is unable to provide water to its entire service area, which includes Greenesboro Borough in Greene County.
Tri-County Water Authority is unable to provide water to much of Scenery Hill and Richeyville, Washington County.
Service to Pennsylvania American Water customers went largely uninterrupted, so DEP has discontinued the precautionary boil water advisory in place for customers of the Aldrich treatment plant.
For Pennsylvania American Water customers who experienced a temporary loss of water service, including approximately 100 homes in the Knob Road area of California, Washington County, the supplier will make notifications when the advisory can be lifted after lab analysis of samples taken from the Brownsville system show that the water is safe to drink.
Without power, the suppliers are unable to draw and treat water from its source. Any widespread service interruption will cause a loss of pressure in water lines, which could result in bacteria entering the lines.

Bedford man charged with raping girl, 9
A Bedford man has been jailed on charges that he raped and sexually assaulted a 9-year-old girl.
Duane Hann Sr., 33, will face a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in Bedford County Central Court on multiple counts.
He was in Bedford County Jail in lieu of $75,000 straight bail.
NORTH
Suppression of statements sought in Korbe case
A defense attorney for the woman charged with killing an FBI agent in 2008 is asking that her client's statements to investigators and a family services worker be suppressed.
Christina Korbe is accused of killing FBI Special Agent Samuel Hicks on Nov. 19, 2008, as he was attempting to serve a federal arrest warrant on her husband with a team of officers.
Ms. Korbe claims that she believed her Indiana Township home was being broken into, and that she fired a single shot from upstairs to protect herself and her two children.
Caroline Roberto, who is representing Ms. Korbe in the federal murder case, claims that Ms. Korbe was never read her Miranda rights.
Further, she wrote in another filing, Ms. Korbe had already invoked her right to have a lawyer present when a caseworker with Children, Youth and Families questioned her on Nov. 25, 2008, while at the Allegheny County Jail.
Ms. Roberto, who also asked that recorded phone calls made by her client from the jail be kept out of trial, has asked U.S. District Judge Terrence F. McVerry for a hearing on the issues.
No trial date has yet been set in the case.
Six animals removed from Shenango house
Police have removed six animals from a home in Shenango, Lawrence County, where they had been left without food or water.
Charges are pending against the residents of the Ellwood Road house. Two dogs, two cats and two turtles were removed. The house was full of feces and in deplorable condition, police said.
CITY
City meter readers get rest of the week off
One weather-related benefit: You probably won't get a ticket for not feeding a parking meter, if you can find a space that's not taken by snow.
Pittsburgh Parking Authority enforcement officers have been given the week off because many street meters are unreachable or inoperable, agency executive director David Onorato said Tuesday.
"There's no work for them," Mr. Onorato said of the 20 full-time officers and around a dozen part-timers. "The way the snow's piled up, the public can't get to the meters, either."
His collectors and ticket writers "can't roll the [coin collection] cans around, and the meters are half-frozen."
Police also can write parking tickets, and the absence of parking enforcement officers does not mean cars can park in tow-away zones.
Property taxes discount deadline extended
Pittsburgh officials are extending the deadline to pay property taxes with a 2 percent discount from today to March 1.
"We know that it's been difficult for some folks who prefer to pay their taxes in person to get Downtown," Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said in a news release. "Right now all of our residents have other pressing matters to address due to the storm, and this extension will give them one less thing to worry about."
Allegheny County's deadline for paying property taxes with a 2 percent discount is March 31.
New government affairs manager hired for city
The city of Pittsburgh has hired Paul McKrell, who was Mayor Luke Ravenstahl's campaign manager, as its new government affairs manager, effective Monday.
Mr. McKrell is expected to earn between $50,000 and $60,000 and report to chief of staff Yarone Zober. Mr. McKrell had been considered a potential candidate for the state House seat formerly held by Don Walko, now an Allegheny County Common Pleas Court judge. Mr. Ravenstahl's brother, Adam Ravenstahl, is running for that seat.
Website can access hot spots in city
The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership unveiled Tuesday a website designed for use on mobile devices that will use a smartphone's GPS to find nearby places in Pittsburgh to park, eat, shop, stay or live.
The website is m.downtownpittsburgh.com and is accessible on most smartphones, such as the iPhone, BlackBerry and Android.
Haiti Relief Concert to be rescheduled
The Haiti Relief Concert originally scheduled for Valentine's Day at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall in Oakland has been postponed due to the weather.
The concert featuring The Clarks, Bill Deasy, the Freedom Band and Good Brother Earl will be rescheduled for a later date. All previously purchased tickets will be honored for the new concert date.
STATE
State Sen. Robert Mellow to retire after 40 years
The state Senate's longest-serving member and Democratic minority leader is retiring from the Senate.
Sen. Robert Mellow said Tuesday that he will not seek re-election to an 11th consecutive term. The Lackawanna County Democrat's term expires Nov. 30.
Mr. Mellow, 67, says he wants to spend more time with his daughters and grandchildren after nearly 40 years of putting up with the demands of public office.
He was first elected to the state Senate in 1970.
SOUTH
Canonsburg care home death ruled accidental
The death over the weekend of a Kingdom Manor personal care home resident in Canonsburg has been ruled accidental, the Washington County coroner's office said.
The victim, Wayne E. Murphy, 60, was pronounced dead at 7:40 p.m. where he was found, at the bottom of outside stairs behind Mount Olive Baptist Church on Greenside Avenue. Coroner S. Timothy Warco said Mr. Murphy died of hypothermia.
The church is across the street from the personal care home, which the state has ordered closed.
The 23-bed Kingdom Manor already was slated to close after its provisional license was revoked in January by the state Department of Public Welfare.
Washington, Greene county water disruptions persist
The state Department of Environmental Protection said water disruptions due to the heavy snow persist for customers of several public water suppliers, especially those in Washington and Greene counties.
In Greene County, the East Dunkard Water Association is has been unable to supply customers in outlying service areas and water supply has been disrupted in the entire service area of the Dunkard Valley Joint Municipal Authority in Greensboro.
Tri-County Water Authority has been unable to pump water to approximately 600 customers in Scenery Hill and Richeyville in Washington County.
Once water service is restored, the DEP said customers should boil water for at least a minute before drinking or using it in any food preparation.
On Monday, the DEP lifted its boil water advisory for customers of Pennsylvania American Water who are supplied by the company's Aldrich treatment plant, but boiling is still recommended for approximately 100 customers in the Knob Road area of California, Washington County.

Boil-Water Advisory Issued in Metaline; Filtration System has Problem

The Washington state Department of Health issued the following news release:
Residents of the Town of Metaline are advised to boil their drinking water because of a problem with the new filtration system the community is building.
Until new filters are installed next week, the treatment plant isn't able to filter-out harmful germs, such as cryptosporidium, which can cause gastrointestinal illness.
The town of 179 people has just finished building a new water treatment plant, using federal economic recovery money and a Community Development Block Grant. The town hasn't officially accepted the plant from the contractors.
The problem appears to be caused by clay from the sand-filtration system clogging-up filter bags. The state Department of Health is working closely with the community and its engineer to resolve the issue so the new system functions as designed. Meanwhile, the agency advises residents to boil for at least one minute any tap water they use for drinking, brushing teeth, cooking, washing dishes, or making ice. The advisory is expected to continue into next week.
"When you're installing new equipment and learning how to operate and maintain it, issues are bound to crop up," said Denise Clifford, director of the Agency's Office of Drinking Water. "We're working with the community to help them fix the problem, and until it's resolved we're making sure that residents know what they should do to protect their health."
Town officials urge residents to be patient.
"We're doing our best to get the new equipment working as it should," said Mayor Pete Daggett. "In the end, we're going to have a great system that will provide high-quality drinking water for years to come."

Boroughs Set Up Emergency Call; Strasburg, E-Town, Akron Water Customers Can Be Alerted 'At The Push Of A Button'

Strasburg Borough has a faster way of informing its residents when there is a water, weather or other emergency.
Swift911 is a new service contracted by the Strasburg Borough Water Authority to meet new mandates from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Elizabethtown and Akron boroughs also signed contracts for the service provided by Swiftreach Networks Inc.
Although all municipalities are required to have a notification system in place by May 10, Strasburg Borough officials got theirs up and running after traces of the E. coli bacteria were found in January in the water supply.
The telephone messaging system can handle a large volume of calls in a short amount of time, Lisa Boyd, borough manager, said.
"It works by making phone calls to specific people or areas in the event of an emergency," she said.
Swift911 downloaded 973 home phone numbers from local telephone listings, Boyd said. Of the 1,175 water and sewer customers in the borough, 30 have entered their contact information on the borough's Web site at lancaster.pa.us/strasburg_boro.
The system can contact a resident by phone, e-mail or text message in the event of an emergency, and they will receive a recorded message informing them of the problem, Boyd said.
The authority can be selective as to who receives the call, she said. For instance, it could notify customers who live within a 2-mile radius of a water main break.
Potential uses range from community bulletins such as snow days to warning people about storms, she said.
The water authority is paying for the service, which is a flat fee of $1,700 a year no matter how many times it's used, Boyd said. The borough also will continue to do a media notice about water emergencies such as "boil water" advisories.
"I think the system is going to be awesome," she said.
Swift911 also is being used by Elizabethtown Borough Water Authority.
Sarah Yarger, assistant manager of Elizabethtown Authority, said the service was recommended by the Pennsylvania Rural Water Association.
Elizabethtown has used the system several times since it was implemented in August, John Caldwell, water authority manager, said.
"The nice thing about it is that the system contacts all of our 4,300 customers in 10 to 15 minutes so we don't have to," he said.
The water authority shares the system with the borough, he said.
Roni Ryan, borough manager, said, "The borough has used the system a couple of times since its inception, most recently to notify residents of the snow emergency declared in last week's snow event. "It has served as a valuable tool to effectively and efficiently communicate with our residents."
The service is expected to begin serving Akron water customers within a month.
Borough officials said calls to alert customers will be initiated within 24 hours of any contamination or low-pressure readings.
Swiftreach Networks, the company hired by Akron, also can send a recorded message to residents in other emergency situations, reaching thousands of numbers in less than a minute.
"At the push of a button, they'll start the calling," Terry Reber, borough vice president, said at a Feb. 8 council meeting.
Reber said the company will develop a notification database using numbers customers provide for their water bills. Residents also will have the option to add cell phone and pager numbers or e-mail addresses to the call list.
The borough will pay $820 for the service in its first year, with an annual fee of $720 starting in 2011. Swiftreach will provide 500 calls for free; after that the rate is 10 cents per call.

New Holland Borough has issued a "boil water" advisory for its water customers in the wake of a water-system malfunction Thursday.
As a result, the water supply has a higher chance of having disease-causing organisms, officials said in a news release.
"People with severely compromised immune systems, infants and some sickly or elderly may be at increased risk," the release said.
Water should be boiled for at least a minute, it said.
The advisory can be lifted only after an outside laboratory confirms that the water is safe to drink.
Borough officials announced Friday that one of the chlorinators supplying the water system malfunctioned, and the chlorine residual at the water's well supply was below the allowable amount.
For details, call the borough at 354-4567 or visit the borough Web page, www.newhollandborough.org.

New Holland Water Safe To Drink

New Holland's water is safe to drink.
Borough officials on Sunday lifted the boil-water advisory that had been in effect since Friday.
"The tests came back negative, and there's no need to boil water anymore," borough manager Richard Fulcher said.
The advisory was announced Friday after one of the chlorinators supplying the water system malfunctioned and the chlorine residual at the water's well supply on South Custer Avenue was below the allowable amount.
According to Fulcher, the borough's water supply was never in any serious danger.
"The chlorine level was barely under the limit, and we caught it as soon as we came in Friday and immediately increased the chlorine," he said. "But state regulations said we had to go with the boil-water advisory, so we did."
State rules stipulated that the borough's water had to be tested and meet quality and safety standards two days in a row before the advisory could be lifted.
A private laboratory was hired to do the testing, which was conducted Friday and Saturday, Fulcher said.
On Sunday, borough officials contacted all the major water customers, such as Eastern Lancaster County School District and local restaurants and nursing homes, to let them know the advisory had been lifted, Fulcher said.
A notice also was placed on the borough's Web site to inform residents.

Another Water Alert In New Holland; Na Small Fuel Spill On The Treatment Plant Floor Sparked The Second Warning In A Week.

They're taking precautions and "just doing the right thing," New Holland Borough Manager Richard Fulcher said Thursday.
"And both of these times could have been a lot worse."
Less than a gallon of diesel fuel fell on a concrete floor at the borough's water treatment plant, leading to a strong odor of fuel in part of the water system this week.
So Thursday, for the second time in less than a week, borough water system officials issued a warning about the system's drinking water.
Some areas of the system have detected the diesel fuel smell in the water, and you should not drink the water if it has this odor, Fulcher said.
Use bottled water or alternative sources for drinking, cooking and preparing food until the notice is rescinded, which could happen by Saturday or Sunday, he said.
The leak on the floor came from a diesel fuel line connected to the plant's emergency generator, a borough news release said.
The diesel odor is particularly present in the southeast part of the borough's service area.
It affects some 100 of the system's 2,000 water customers, including the large Garden Spot Village senior community, and perhaps a total of 1,000 people, Fulcher said.
Anyone who made ice cubes since Wednesday should dispose of them, officials said.
"For this concern, boiling the water does not remove any of the odor or traces of diesel fuel," the release said, adding that people with particular health concerns should contact their doctors.
Officials flushed the water system and shut the system's reservoir, and water testing began immediately Thursday.
Borough officials Sunday lifted a boil-water advisory that had been in effect since the previous Friday after a bacteria concern in the water.
The water-treatment plant is three miles outside New Holland, on Welsh Mountain, Fulcher said.

PLEASANTVILLE RESIDENTS LOSE DRINKING WATER; SUBSEQUENT BOIL ADVISORY IN EFFECT
States News Service

The following information was released by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources:
Residents of Pleasantville are temporarily without drinking water due to a valve break at the city's water supply plant. Once the break is repaired and water service restored, plant officials recommend residents boil water for consumption until further notice.
According to DNR environmental specialist Terisa Thomas, the city of Pleasantville was servicing a main break when another valve broke, causing significant water loss. To repair the problem, water plant officials had to temporarily shut off water service to the town.
Once water is again available, it is recommended that residents boil water before drinking or cooking or use an alternative such as bottled water, due to the potential for bacterial contamination caused by pressure loss in the system.
According to Thomas, the boil advisory is a precaution until bacterial sample results are available. The City of Pleasantville will repair the water main, which is expected to occur this afternoon, flush lines and collect bacteria samples. Once samples have been obtained and deemed acceptable, the advisory will be lifted and the public notified.
During a boil advisory, bring all water to a boil, let it boil for one minute, then cool before using, or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth and food preparation until further notice. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. The water may be used for bathing and other similar purposes. General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available from the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1(800) 426-4791.
For more information, the City of Pleasantville may be contacted at (515) 848-3316.

Bergen County Executive Declares State of Emergency

The Bergen County Executive issued the following news release:
In the wake of a devastating storm that downed countless trees and power lines, leaving tens of thousands of people without power or utilities, Bergen County Executive Dennis McNerney enacted a State of Emergency throughout the County. This declaration authorized the utilization of resources that are not part of day-to-day operations such as using public buildings as temporary shelters. Joining the County Executive at a press conference held today at the Office of Emergency Management were Freeholder Bernadette McPherson, William Longhi, President of Orange and Rockland Electric, Ralph LaRossa, President of PSE&G, and Dennis L. Ciemniecki, President of United Water.
"We are preparing to deploy such resources as transportation and lodging for shelters and looking for assistance from EMS and Hospitals, all due to the extended amount of power outage," said McNerney. "Further, we are opening a countywide shelter at the Bergen Community College gymnasium that will be open to residents and will remain open as long as they need it."
Bergen Community College is located at 400 Paramus Road in Paramus. The shelter will be open at 6:00 PM today. If residents cannot provide their own transportation to the shelter, assistance is available by calling (201) 368-7560. Additionally, if seniors are looking for Shelter, the county's Midland Park senior Center will be open until 10 PM and is located at 46-50 Center Street in Midland Park. If residents are stranded and need a ride, they can call Bergen County OEM at 201-634-3100.
In an effort to determine the cost associated with this weekend's storm, the County Executive asked that all municipalities conduct and submit the Preliminary Damage Assessment report as soon as possible. This will assist the State of New Jersey in requesting potential federal reimbursement.
Advisories were issued via the County's "Reverse 9-1-1" system, which can be used to immediately alert residents of all types of emergencies, including but not limited to terrorist attacks, chemical spills, escaped prisoners, missing children, flooding and blizzards.
"Due to the tremendous storm that impacted Bergen County more than 1.5 million vital emergency phone calls were made with the County's telephone alerting system to communicate boil water advisories on behalf of United Water New Jersey and on behalf of PSE&G warning of the dangers of downed power lines," said Freeholder McPherson. "These emergency calls were made as quickly as the local phone system allows. In the interest of public safety we wanted to communicate these important warnings to residents and regret any inconvenience."
The boil water advisory was issued for the following 16 Bergen County municipalities: Hillsdale, Northvale, Washington Township, Emerson, Alpine, Paramus, Dumont, Englewood Cliffs, Teaneck, Hasbrouck Heights, Carlstadt, Englewood, Tenafly, Palisades Park, Cliffside Park and Ridgefield.
In the affected towns, it is imperative that customers boil their water for one minute when drinking, cooking, baking, making ice cubes, taking medication, brushing teeth, washing food, mixing baby formula or food, mixing juices or drinks, feeding pets and all other consumption, though water does not have to be boiled for showering, washing dishes or clothes.
"I have been working with our Bergen County Office of Emergency Management since the onset of the storm," said McNerney. "There are many trees and power lines down throughout the county, as well as many intersections that are without power. First and foremost, stay away from power lines that are down." Based on the extensive damage, PSE&G is estimating that the majority of customers will be restored by Wednesday with the remainder on Thursday. To report a downed wire, call 1-800-436-PSEG.
"The safety and security of the residents of Bergen County is of the utmost importance to my administration," said McNerney. "Rest assured that we will continue to work with state, local and county officials in response to any and all lingering concerns until all issues have been resolved."
Bergen County's Housing, Health and Human Services Center in Hackensack became an emergency response center during Saturday night's storm when the high winds and rains quickly flooded and necessitated the closure of River Street. Police and County workers rescued stranded motorists and brought them to the Center. The staff at the Center provided towels, clean clothes and hot beverages to individuals who stayed through the evening.
Bergen County's Parks were also impacted by this storm. At the Van Saun Zoo, a tree fell on the Mountain Lion Exhibit, the Budgie House collapsed and another tree fell onto the pony barn, causing damage to the exhibits but leaving their popular inhabitants safe from harm in their respective shelters.

Thousands of residents north of Reno in Sun Valley are being told to boil their water before drinking or cooking with it.
The Sun Valley General Improvement District issued a boil water advisory late Tuesday because one of the district's monthly tests showed a positive result for E-coli.
The order affects about 6,000 water customers. They should boil the water for three minutes before using it. An update on the situation is planned Wednesday afternoon.

Coal Grove boil-water advisory called off: Project reaching finish line

Mar. 19--A long-standing boil-water advisory has been lifted in the Village of Coal Grove, since the upgrades to the water system are almost completed. The precautionary advisory had been in place since November when work on the system began.
"It's been a long process," Mayor Larry McDaniel said.
Fire hydrants and cut-off valves in the city were replaced. The project also included digging a new well and installing a new aerator.
The village also provides water service to portions of Deering.
"The only thing left to be done is the final connection -- the well has been drilled but they're connecting it to the water plant," said Paul Amburgey of E.L. Robinson Engineering.
E.L. Robinson handled the engineering plans and also oversaw the project.
The new cut-off values mean that the village will not have to shut off water for the entire village anytime a leak occurs. That means each leak will take less time to repair.
"It will tremendously help us out with the water," Kevin Markins, Coal Grove water superintendent, said.
Funding for the project was supplied by about $500,000 in stimulus funding. About $100,000 was a loan and the rest was grant money.
"The village very much appreciates getting this stimulus money," Amburgey said.
The old valves, which were installed just after World War II, had seized up and were not working, Amburgey said.
"It was very much needed," he said. "These valves and hydrants were not working. You want to shut off the valve that's closest to the leak. We had so many (valves) not working that large amounts of the system had to be turned off (when there was a leak)."
Besides the cut-off valves, new fire hydrants were also installed in the village. About 25 fire hydrants were installed in the village water's service area.
"There were only a few not working," McDaniel said about the fire hydrants. Before the new hydrants, "(the fire department) just tried to connect to the closest (working) ones."

Terre Hill Hires Firm For Automated Water Notifications

Correspondent
Terre Hill is hiring a New Jersey firm to help it meet new requirements for public notification in the event of water-contamination problems.
At its March 9 meeting, borough council authorized the use of SwiftReach Networks of Mahwah, N.J., for making automated public phone calls. The initial cost of the service is not to exceed $450.
The move comes in response to new requirements, which take effect May 10, from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Municipalities must issue public notification within 24 hours of a boil water advisory for contamination, if chlorine residual falls below minimum levels, or if other problems arise with the water system.
The call service can also be used for other types of emergencies.
In other business, council received the 2009 review of the Terre Hill Fire Company from Chief Troy Weaver.
Weaver reported that the volunteer fire company responded to 68 emergency calls last year, which was a decrease of 24 from 2008. Of the total calls in 2009, 26 calls were made in the borough, 25 in East Earl Township and 17 in other municipalities.
Vehicle accidents accounted for the highest number of calls, with firefighters responding to 13.
East Earl Police Chief Kevin McCarthy reported that during February, the department answered 10 calls for service, issued 12 traffic citations and conducted two criminal investigations in the borough.
In other business council:
nAdopted an ordinance to charge a tapping fee to property owners who connect to the municipal water system or increase the use of a property previously connected to the system. The ordinance allows the borough to enforce tapping fees in the amount of $2,500.
nAuthorized reduction of sewer charges for Glenn Ammons, 330 Broad St., in the amount of $346.50 for 49,500 gallons of water that was not discharged into the sewer system. The water leaked from a break in an underground pipe between his house and garage.
nAuthorized a contract with Patriot Energy for electric generation services for 12 months.
nAuthorized acceptance of an improvement guaranty agreement and letter of credit for $25,694 for the Alvin S. & Mable N. Martin subdivision on Vine Street. Council also accepted a stormwater-management agreement and easement declaration for the subdivision, and granted final approval for the project.
nAuthorized Robert Rissler and Mark Rissler to attend the Pennsylvania American Water Works Association conference in Lancaster at a cost not to exceed $400.

10 new hybrid buses expected to cut RTA's costs
DAYTON - The Regional Transportation Authority said it aims to be "Ohio's greenest fleet" with the addition of 10 new hybrid diesel/electric buses. RTA said the 40-foot coaches are powered by a "clean diesel hybrid electrical propulsion system" that reduces emissions and saves fuel. RTA used federal stimulus money to buy the buses. It spent $13.3 million for the hybrids. RTA said the hybrids use the latest General Motors parallel drive technology. The buses "utilize long-life, nonhazardous and maintenance-free NiMH batteries that capture and store braking energy as well as solid state advanced controllers that manage and blend power sources to optimize performance," RTA said.
RTA will unveil several of the buses at an 11 a.m. ceremony Monday, April 5, at downtown's Wright Stop Plaza Transit Center, 4 S. Main St.

The following information was released by the state of Rhode Island:
The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) reminds Rhode Islanders that water from municipal public water systems is safe to drink. Rhode Island has separate systems for public drinking water and for sewer treatment. Flooding has had minimal effect on the public drinking water systems. If a Boil Water Advisory is enacted, this information will be posted to HEALTH's website (www.health.ri.gov). There are currently precautionary Boil Water Advisories related to the flooding at four very small public water systems: Lindhbrook Water Company, Meadowlark, Inc., Ashaway Line and Twine, and Nuweetooun School at Tomaquag Museum. People who are supplied water from these water systems should boil their water for one minute before using it for drinking and cooking until the Boil Water Advisory has been lifted.
Private wells that have been flooded (wells that have standing water around them) should be considered contaminated. Private well owners should see http://www.ri.gov/press/view/11067 for additional safety guidance.
Residents of areas where sewage treatment and pumping plants are not working properly due to flooding (Warwick and West Warwick) are reminded to conserve water whenever possible. Limit toilet flushing and showering, and avoid using dishwashers and washing machines. These appliances all drain water into the sewage treatment system. Continual use could cause sewage backup and overflow. Also, people should not drain sump pumps into toilets, tubs, or sinks. Drain them instead into your yard or storm water drains.

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
The City of Ephrata ended its boil-water advisory today. Residents no longer have to boil their tap water.
The state Department of Health and the city issued the advisory on Friday after E. coli was found in one water sample and coliform bacteria were found in several other water samples. The advisory affected about 7,100 people, including more than 3,200 homes and businesses in the Grant County community.
The city has disinfected and flushed the water system and collected 16 water samples for testing. All of the samples were satisfactory, which shows the water is once again safe to drink. The state and the Grant County Health District have not received any reports of illnesses linked to the water issue.
The city and state suspect that contamination got into one of the city's wells. The well was shut down on Friday. It will be kept offline until repairs are made and the water is shown to be safe.
"We're pleased with the city's quick response to this situation," said Denise Clifford, director of the Office of Drinking Water. "Getting the word out about health advisories quickly and effectively is a key to protecting the public's health when things like this happen."

NMED Issues 'Boil Water Advisory' for Tajique MDWCA in Torrance County

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau is advising customers of the Tajique Mutual Domestic Water Consumer's Association to boil their water for five minutes before drinking, cooking and dishwashing. The water supplied to adjacent areas by other water suppliers is not affected and is not subject to this boil water advisory.
NMED issued the advisory on April 21 due to multiple failures by the Tajique MDWCA to test for bacteria in the drinking water as required by the New Mexico Drinking Water Regulations. The small community water system serves approximately 180 people on the east side of the Manzano Mountains in Torrance County. NMED required that the association notify its customers and members that the water system is not meeting water sampling and reporting requirements. While there is no recent indication of contamination of the drinking water, without bacteria water sample results customers cannot be certain of the safety of the water provided by the the association.
Customers of the water system are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing. If present, microorganisms in drinking water may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, even death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
NMED is pursuing an enforcement action against the Tajique MDWCA for failure to comply with the Drinking Water Regulations.
For more information please contact Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager at (505) 476-

"BOIL WATER" ADVISORY ISSUED BY BASE OFFICIALS
States News Service
April 21, 2010 Wednesday


Copyright 2010 States News Service
Length: 1260 words
Byline: States News Service
Dateline: CANNON AIR FORCE BASE, N.M.
Body


The following information was released by Cannon Air Force Base:
by 27th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs
The following are frequently asked questions with responses:
Is the Cannon AFB drinking water contaminated?
E. coli bacteria were found in the Cannon AFB water supply on April 20, 2010 and confirmed on April 21, 2010. The positive sample was found at The Landing Zone. The source of the contamination is currently unknown. As a precaution and to ensure the safety of consumers of Cannon AFB water we have issued a Boil Water Advisory for Cannon AFB proper and Chavez West housing. THIS INCLUDES THE LOW FLUORIDE TAP ON BASE. To date, the medical group hasn't reported any illnesess associated with the contamination.
Is the Cannon AFB water system connected to the surrounding communities?
No, the Cannon AFB water system is entirely self-contained. The affected water system is limited to Cannon AFB proper and Chavez West housing (not base housing in Clovis and Portales).
Is the entire water system contaminated?
The contaminated sample was found at The Landing Zone. As a precautionary measure until we determine the extent of contamination, the Boil Water Advisory is in effect for Cannon AFB proper and Chavez West housing until further notice from the installation commander or the public affairs office. THIS INCLUDES THE LOW FLUORIDE TAP ON BASE.
How can this happen?
Bacterial contamination can occur when increased run-off enters the drinking water source (for example, following heavy rains). It can also happen due to a break in the distribution of pipe systems, a problem at the storage tank or a failure in the water treatment process. The cause is unknown in this case, but we will release further details when available.
What is being done?
The 27th Special Operations Civil Engineer Squadron and Medical Group are working hard to resolve the issue. We increased chlorine levels throughout the water distribution system to eliminate the bacteria and are investigating the cause of the contamination. Updated sampling results are expected by close of business Friday, April 23, 2010, and as soon as results are analyzed they will be released.
Is the water safe to drink?
On Cannon AFB and in Chavez West housing, you must boil tap water for five minutes to be safe for drinking until further notice from the installation commander or the public affairs office. Drinking water for pets should also be boiled.
Is the water safe for household use?
You must boil all tap water for five minutes before using for cooking, dishwashing or brushing teeth. This includes water for making ice and water treated by home water filters.
- You may shower and shave, but be careful not to drink any water
- Throw away all ice in your freezer
- Discard beverages made at home with tap water (i.e. lemonade, iced tea)
- Sterilize water containers (i.e. dog bowls, water filter pitchers, ice trays)
- Dishwasher use is not recommended, boil water to hand wash dishes
- Handwashing and showering is only OK only with antibacterial soap
- Hand sanitizer use is recommended
- Bleach tablets for drinking water are not recommended
- Bleach can be used for household cleaning but should not ingested in drinking water
- Boil water for brushing teeth, even when using mouthwash
Can I use bottled water instead?
Yes, bottled water is safe for drinking, brushing teeth and household use. We will inform you when results show no bacteria in the water system and when you no longer need to boil water or drink bottled water.
What are the symptoms I should look for?
Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, jaundice, headaches and fatigue. These symptoms, however, are not necessarily associated with disease-causing organisms in drinking water, but may also be caused by a number of factors other than your drinking water.
When should I seek medical care?
Servicemembers and dependants should call the appointment line at 575-784-2778 if you or a family member experiences nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting more than two days (children should not use anti-diarrheal medications), particularly when these symptoms are associated with a low-grade fever. Seek immediate medical care for children under three years old, anyone with a disease or illness that weakens their immune system, people who cannot take their prescribed medications due to vomiting and people showing nervous system symptoms such as slurred speech, muscle weakness, double vision or difficulty swallowing.
Should I go to the emergency room?
Go to the nearest emergency room if the person has a fever higher than 102.5F, has sharp or cramping pains persisting for more than 10-15 minutes, is vomiting blood or having bloody bowel movements, stops urinating, has urine that is dark in color or has problems breathing, speaking or swallowing. Also, go to the emergency room if the person's abdomen swells or skin or eyes turn yellow.
The Cannon AFB clinic does not have an emergency room, and emergency care should be sought at the Plains Regional Medical Center or Roosevelt County Hospital.
Who is most at risk of illness?
Some people are more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. People at increased risk include infants, young children, elderly and people with severely compromised immune systems, such as people undergoing chemotherapy, people who have had an organ transplant and people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders.
How often is our water tested for contamination?
In accordance with EPA regulations, public water is tested monthly for contamination. Cannon AFB routinely monitors drinking water in accordance with all New Mexico and federal standards. A test of the Cannon AFB water system on April 17, 2010 indicated no evidence of contamination.
A "boil water" advisory has been issued for Cannon Air Force Base and Chavez West housing. Do not ingest water without first boiling it for five minutes until further notice.
How often does the water test positive for contamination?
Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain small amounts of certain contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate the water poses a health risk. The sources of drinking water include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and can pick up substances resulting from animals or human activity. To ensure water is safe to drink, the EPA regulates the amount of certain contaminants in public water systems. For more information about contaminants and potential health effects call the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 800-426-4791.
What is E. Coli and why is it dangerous?
Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a type of bacteria naturally found in the intestines and feces of warm-blooded animals. There are many different types, and most are harmless, but some may cause illness. E. coli is commonly used as an indicator of fecal pollution of water. The EPA has determined that the presence of fecal coliforms or E. coli is a serious health concern. These bacteria are usually not harmful, but their presence in drinking water is serious because they are typically associated with sewage or animal wastes. This is generally a result of a problem with water treatment or pipes that distribute the water and indicates that water may be contaminated with organisms that can cause disease.
For questions, call 27th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs at (575) 784-7131 or the Straight Talk Line at (575) 784-6909.

Denver Eyes System For Emergency Notifications

Correspondent
Adam Webber, Denver Borough's mayor, is advocating a public notification system that could be used to help with cases such as missing juveniles, elderly walk-aways or crimes happening in particular neighborhoods.
Borough Manager Michael Hession said the borough is under a May 10 deadline for adopting a system to notify residents quickly when a "boil water advisory" is necessary.
Municipalities must comply with new state emergency-preparedness regulations regarding the water supply. But many communities, while meeting that requirement, also are looking at using new alert systems for other emergencies.
At its April 12 meeting, Denver council agreed to place the emergency notification system issue on the agenda for the April 27 regional meeting of Cocalico-area elected officials.
Police Chief George Beever will talk with East Cocalico police officials for their input.
Denver plans to subscribe to the SwiftReach Networks notification system for one year at a cost of $660. An additional fee is incurred when the system is used to notify people of emergencies such as a boil water advisory.
In other business at the April 12 meeting, several council members and citizens commented about teenagers who are displaying verbally abusive behavior at Denver Park. The teens also allegedly move benches that are not chained onto a cement pad.
"Many people carry cell phones," Beever said. "It would be great if, while this was going on, someone would call (the police)."
Meanwhile, the municipal expansion project continues with an on-time, end-of-May completion anticipated. Council approved a $1,101 change order request to provide the addition of foil facing to the unfaced ceiling insulation as directed by the building inspector.
"If you had a fire, it would not go right to the insulation," Hession said.
After Councilman Rodney Redcay asked how the item was omitted from the architect's plans, Hession said he intended to bring the matter up at the next meeting.
In other business:
nDenver's Arbor Day celebration will be held on Saturday, April 24, at 9 a.m. at 28 N. 6th St. A tree will be planted and a Tree City U.S.A. plaque will be presented.
nAndy Boyer, Denver's emergency services coordinator, reported that he and Hession completed the county emergency services survey. Boyer is working with Denver Nursing Home to update and complete its emergency plan.
nAbandonment proceedings started for a pickup truck on the United Methodist Church parking lot.
nTwo new police officers will begin their field training the week of May 10.

The New Mexico Environment Department on Wednesday issued a "boil water advisory" for Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.
The advisory came after E.coli contamination levels exceeded the maximum allowed for drinking water.
E.coli indicates the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes and could contain disease-causing organisms.
The water system is being disinfected and flushed out.
The agency also issued boil water advisories for the 50 customers of Punta de Agua Mutual Domestic Water Consumer's Association and the 180 customers of the Tajique Mutual Domestic Water Consumer's Association, both in Torrance County.
The advisories tell customers to boil water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing.
The agency issued advisories for the Torrance County associations because they failed to test for bacteria.

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau has issued a "boil water advisory" for Cannon Air Force Base.
NMED issued the advisory on April 21 after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level for E. coli was discovered in drinking water at the Cannon AFB. NMED requires Cannon to notify water consumers of the finding. This advisory only applies to the drinking water at the base and does not extend to any of the other surrounding water systems.
Consumers of water at the base are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing. The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
Actions have been initiated to disinfect the water system and identify possible sources of contamination, establish acceptable disinfection, and flush out the water system. NMED's Drinking Water Bureau will continue to provide assistance to the water system and will test the water until no further threat of contamination remains.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 476-8638.

SANTA FE, N.M., April 21 -- The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau is advising customers of the Tajique Mutual Domestic Water Consumer's Association to boil their water for five minutes before drinking, cooking and dishwashing. The water supplied to adjacent areas by other water suppliers is not affected and is not subject to this boil water advisory.
NMED issued the advisory on April 21 due to multiple failures by the Tajique MDWCA to test for bacteria in the drinking water as required by the New Mexico Drinking Water Regulations. The small community water system serves approximately 180 people on the east side of the Manzano Mountains in Torrance County.NMED required that the association notify its customers and members that the water system is not meeting water sampling and reporting requirements. While there is no recent indication of contamination of the drinking water, without bacteria water sample results customers cannot be certain of the safety of the water provided by the the association.
Customers of the water system are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing. If present, microorganisms in drinking water may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, even death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
NMED is pursuing an enforcement action against the Tajique MDWCA for failure to comply with the Drinking Water Regulations.

Apr. 22, 2010 (Center for Independent Media delivered by Newstex) --

Drinking water at Cannon Air Force Base has become contaminated with high levels of the bacteria E. coli, possibly from sewage, prompting a œboil water advisory from the state   Environment DepartmentWednesday.

Water consumers on base were advised to boil water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, washing dishes or bathing with it.

Other water systems in the area were not affected, Environment Department officials said.

œThe presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms, a Department advisory states.

While most strains of E. coliare harmless, and some strains normally live in the human gut without causing disease, other strains can cause severe illness, the advisory states.

The air bases water was being disinfected Wednesday, the advisory states.

The state has œrequired the air base to notify consumers of the finding, the advisory states. The base web page prominently announced the problem Wednesday evening.

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau issued a "boil water advisory" for the Vallecitos Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association in Rio Arriba County.
Customers of the water system are advised to boil water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, bathing and dishwashing.
NMED issued the advisory on April 23rd after it was determined that the water system is not meeting the treatment requirements for turbidity. NMED requires the water system, located in Rio Arriba County about 45 miles northwest of Espanola, to notify its consumers of the findings. The water supplied to adjacent areas by other water suppliers is not affected and is not under this boil water advisory.
Turbidity has no health effects; however, turbidity can interfere with disinfection and provide a medium for microbial growth. High turbidity levels may indicate the presence of disease causing organisms. NMED sets drinking water standards and has determined that the presence of microbiological contaminants is a health concern at certain levels of exposure. If water is inadequately treated, microbiological contaminants in the water may cause disease. Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches and fatigue. However, these symptoms are not just associated with disease causing organisms in drinking water and may be caused by other medical conditions. NMED has set enforceable requirements for treating drinking water to reduce the risk of these adverse health effects. Treatment such as filtering and disinfecting the water removes or destroys microbiological contaminants.
Actions have been initiated to correct and reduce the levels of turbidity entering the water system. NMED will continue to assist the water system and help identify the cause of the treatment problem.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 476-8638.

Apr. 23, 2010 (Center for Independent Media delivered by Newstex) --

Several New Mexico water systems are   struggling to bring down arsenic levels, but when it comes to reducing the amount of fecal matter in the drinking water, the state is seeing tangible gains, state records suggest.

Bacterial contamination events like the one leading to this weeks state advisory about water at Cannon Air Force Base have become less common over recent years, according to a state Environment Department official and state records.

œWeve really been working with the water systems to improve compliance,   Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Operations Manager   Mike Huber told The Independent Thursday. œIts been coming down.

The New Mexico   Environment Department issued the states first three œboil advisories this week, including the air base warning. But   two were administrative advisories, issued as a precaution because two Torrance County water systems have failed to comply with state-mandated bacterial testing of drinking water.

Boil advisories resulting from actual bacterial contamination of drinking water have become less common over recent years, records show.

Over the past four years, the number of contamination-triggered boil advisories has dropped from nine per year in both 2006 and 2007, to seven in 2008, and three last year, department records show.

Administrative or precautionary advisories have become slightly more common over the same period of time, from one in 2006, one in 2007, three in 2008 and two last year ” possibly suggesting increased enforcement efforts by the state.

Boil advisories are usually triggered by elevated concentrations of the bacteria   E. coli, department records show. E. coli strains may be harmless or dangerous to human health, but elevations indicate that animal waste or leaking septic systems have introduced fecal matter into drinking water.

Fecal matter can carry other, more dangerous strains of bacteria.

Boil advisories are more common for small community water systems and trailer park water systems, department records show.

Boiling water for five minutes prior to drinking, cooking, bathing or washing dishes with it kills the bacteria, department records suggest.

The state Environment Department has lifted a "boil water" advisory it put into effect for Cannon Air Force Base last week.
The advisory was issued Wednesday after E.coli contamination levels exceeded the maximum allowed for drinking water at the base near Clovis. E.coli indicates water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes and could contain disease-causing organisms.
Officials say extensive testing of the water system found the contamination was isolated to one outside faucet, and that there was no evidence contamination had spread to the base water distribution system.

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau issued a "boil water advisory" for the Turquoise Trail Elementary School water system in Santa Fe County.
NMED issued the advisory on April 29 after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for E. coli was discovered in drinking water from the Turquoise Trail Elementary School water system. NMED requires Turquoise Trail Elementary School water system to notify its consumers of the finding. This advisory only applies to the drinking water at the school and does not extend to any of the other surrounding water systems.
Consumers of water at the school are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking dishwashing and bathing. The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, even death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
Actions have been initiated to disinfect the water system and identify possible sources of contamination, establish acceptable disinfection, and flush out the water system. The Drinking Water Bureau will continue to provide assistance to the water system and help identify the source of the problem.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 476-8638.

The New Mexican
Drinking water at Turquoise Trail Charter School was found to exceed the maximum contaminant level for E. coli on Wednesday and the
state Environment Department issued a "boil-water advisory" for the system on Thursday.
School Director Sandra B. Davis said that she knew of no children sickened by drinking water from the school's fountains.
According to Davis, the problem was identified as a faulty chlorinator, which has since been fixed.
Meanwhile the school
shut off the drinking fountains and provided children with bottled water. It is using bottled water in the kitchen as well.
Davis also sent a notice home to parents Thursday advising them of the situation, as required by the state.
She said the well is tested monthly and that although the amount of E. coli was above the recommended level, she was told nobody was in serious danger.
Davis said the water system was being flushed and she expected the problem to be resolved this weekend.
The advisory only applies
to the drinking water at
the school and does not extend to any of the other
surrounding community-water systems.
A boil-water advisory means consumers should boil the water for five minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, dishwashing or bathing.
E. coli is a bacterial organism that indicates a water system has been contaminated by raw sewage or human waste.
Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals.
But in a news release, the state Environment Department said that a positive E. coli test in a drinking water supply might indicate dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms, which can cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death.
Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the Cities of of Scammon and Roseland, which are located in Cherokee County.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory due to a break in a water main, which resulted in a loss of pressure in the distribution system. The water main has since been repaired, but whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) residuals may drop to levels that are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
Residents in the Cities of Scammon and Roseland served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. The city and/or KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded.

The following information was released by the Tennessee Department of Health:
As residents in many Tennessee counties work to move forward in the aftermath of this past weekends devastating storms, the Tennessee Department of Health and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation remind citizens to take precautions to stay healthy.
While most municipal drinking water utilities are reporting their water is meeting safe drinking water standards, several water systems are encountering problems, and it is vital that customers listen to the information local utilities and health departments are sharing regarding water supplies. The message may change relative to a specific water system due to breaks in distribution lines or an inability to maintain adequate water pressure in the distribution system. These kinds of problems can lead to potential issues of contamination.
The Department of Environment and Conservation is maintaining communications with local utilities and providing technical assistance. Currently, there are boil water advisories for the following water systems:
Brentwood (Williamson Co.)
Lexington Water System (Henderson Co.)
Poplar Grove Utility District (Tipton Co.)
Jackson Energy Authority (Madison Co.)
City of Trenton (Madison Co.)
Town of Michie (McNairy Co.)
Bon Aqua-Lyles Utility District (Hickman Co.) TDEC has recommended an advisory
Centerville Water System (Hickman Co.) TDEC has recommended an advisory
Waynesboro Water System (Wayne Co.)
Mt. Pleasant Water System, partial coverage area under advisory (Maury Co.)
Lobelville Water System (Perry Co.) TDEC has recommended an advisory
Ridgewood Park Water System, partial coverage area under advisory (Giles Co.)
In addition to adhering to boil water advisories, it is critical that water customers in flooded areas who have water service adhere to water conservation measures in order to keep water service available.
This is particularly critical for people in Davidson and Williamson counties. One of Metro Nashvilles two water treatment plants is offline due to flooding, and Metro is asking residents to cut their water consumption by half. Harpeth Valley Utility District, which serves parts of Davidson and Williamson counties, is also currently operating at half capacity. The Department of Environment and Conservation strongly recommends all municipal water customers in counties affected by flooding practice water conservation measures for nonessential uses. This includes taking steps such as delaying clothes washing, running dishwashers, flushing toilets, washing cars, filling pools and hot tubs, etc.
Having an ample supply of clean drinking water is a top priority in an emergency situation. Local emergency management agencies can request assistance from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency to secure bottled water should that need arise. Local health officials and water systems are the best sources to answer questions about whether water in a specific area is safe to use.
Residents affected by boil water advisories or who have private wells and are experiencing cloudy well water may have to find a source of safe drinking water or know how to treat their water for use in certain activities, such as drinking, making ice, washing hands, and brushing teeth. Residents in areas affected by flooding should listen to local officials to find out if your water is safe and take the following precautions:
Avoid using water for drinking or other purposes unless you know it is safe.
Practice water conservation.
Potentially contaminated tap water often can be made safe to drink by boiling, adding disinfectants or filtering.
Boil water if instructed. This is the preferred alternative for treating water at home for consumption because it kills the widest variety of germs and pathogens. Bring water to a constant boil and boil for at least 1 minute. Let the water cool sufficiently before drinking.
If boiling is not possible, adding ordinary, unscented laundry bleach (at the rate of 1/8 teaspoon per 1 gallon of water) provides some treatment. Use bleach that does not have added scents, mix well, and wait 30 minutes or more before drinking.
If water is cloudy, strain it through a clean cloth or coffee filter before boiling or adding bleach. Contaminants often attach to the particles in the water.
It is important to note that the above treatment methods do not apply to flood waters. People should avoid contact with flood waters if at all possible, and floodwater should not be consumed, even with home treatment. In addition to safety considerations with swift currents, floodwater can contain sewage, petroleum products and other chemicals.
Wells that have been overtopped by floodwaters should only be used after floodwaters recede, then prior to use, the water withdrawn should not be used without boiling or adding bleach. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation can assist well owners with information on well disinfection.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation issued the following news release:
As residents in many Tennessee counties work to move forward in the aftermath of this past weekend's devastating storms, the Tennessee Department of Health and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation remind citizens to take precautions to stay healthy.
While most municipal drinking water utilities are reporting their water is meeting safe drinking water standards, several water systems are encountering problems, and it is vital that customers listen to the information local utilities and health departments are sharing regarding water supplies. The message may change relative to a specific water system due to breaks in distribution lines or an inability to maintain adequate water pressure in the distribution system. These kinds of problems can lead to potential issues of contamination.
The Department of Environment and Conservation is maintaining communications with local utilities and providing technical assistance. Currently, there are boil water advisories for the following water systems:
* Brentwood (Williamson Co.)
* Lexington Water System (Henderson Co.)
* Poplar Grove Utility District (Tipton Co.)
* Jackson Energy Authority (Madison Co.)
* City of Trenton (Madison Co.)
* Town of Michie (McNairy Co.)
* Bon Aqua-Lyles Utility District (Hickman Co.) - TDEC has recommended an advisory
* Centerville Water System (Hickman Co.) - TDEC has recommended an advisory
* Waynesboro Water System (Wayne Co.)
* Mt. Pleasant Water System, partial coverage area under advisory (Maury Co.)
* Lobelville Water System (Perry Co.) - TDEC has recommended an advisory
* Ridgewood Park Water System, partial coverage area under advisory (Giles Co.)
In addition to adhering to boil water advisories, it is critical that water customers in flooded areas who have water service adhere to water conservation measures in order to keep water service available.

Flooding in Nashville

BRIAN WILLIAMS, anchor (Venice, Louisiana):
We shift our coverage now tonight to the other major disaster playing out now in Nashville. Massive flooding has left at least a dozen people dead. Thousands of people have been evacuated after an astonishing 13 inches of rain fell over a two-day period. Our own Ron Mott is there on the scene for us tonight.
Ron, good evening.
RON MOTT reporting:
Brian, good evening to you. This is the scene in downtown Nashville tonight. We're on the corner of 2nd Avenue South and Molloy. There's an intersection back there somewhere; it is a lake tonight. At least 22 have died, at least 12 here in Tennessee. And the concern going forward is there may be even more victims who have yet to be discovered.
Parts of Tennessee were turned into islands, from Memphis to downtown Nashville, with thousands of homes and businesses flooded after a record downpour this weekend, cars stacked up like toys in one front yard. This portable classroom took a ride down Interstate 24 before disintegrating. A house burned to the ground, despite being surrounded by water.
Mr. KARL DEAN (Nashville Mayor): There's a lot to be done, but we'll get it done. This is a great city, and obviously we've been through challenges before and we'll meet this one.
MOTT: In Music City, where an unprecedented 13-plus inches fell Saturday and Sunday, the Titans' football field was underwater, which also submerged the lobby of the Opry Land Hotel, forcing 1500 guests to spend the night in a high school. The Grand Ole Opry House and the Country Music Hall of Fame were also taking on water. Elsewhere, in hundreds of water rescues in the region, strangers became heroes.
Unidentified Man #1: I saw this ma--this little girl who's right there and her aunt in the--in the water, and no one was helping them. So I just grabbed the little girl.
Unidentified Woman: Thank you so much. Thank you.
MOTT: The Cumberland River, which snakes near downtown, was expected to crest Monday night at 52 feet, 12 feet above flood stage. To minimize damage, floodgates were opened.
JIM CANTORE reporting:
We've had three months' worth of rain in just 48 hours. It's impossible for the watershed to handle that kind of rainfall. So the trick is, how do we get that water through the city of Nashville without exacerbating what we've already got going on here?
MOTT: The deadly line of storms brought tornadoes along with the rain, also claiming lives in Mississippi and Kentucky.
Unidentified Man #2: I know Mother Nature can be cruel, and certainly she's dealt us a really bad hand this past weekend.
MOTT: All Nashville public schools are set to be closed tomorrow. Meantime, parents are being urged tonight to keep their kids from playing in this water. It's pretty toxic stuff. In one part of town there is a boiled water advisory. And because a treatment facility is also underwater here, folks are being asked to use water sparingly. Brian:
WILLIAMS: Just an unbelievable scene there in Nashville and throughout that region. Ron Mott, thanks.

Kentucky Division of Water Provides Guidance on Emergency Water Disinfection
Targeted News Service

Length: 524 words

The Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet issued the following news release:
As power outages, low water pressure problems and flood conditions persist in some areas of the commonwealth following last weekend's storms, the Kentucky Division of Water urges residents to properly disinfect water for in-home use, including drinking, cooking, making prepared drinks and brushing teeth.
The easiest alternative is to use bottled water if it is available and has not been exposed to flood waters.
In the absence of safe bottled water, tap water should be boiled to kill most types of disease-causing organisms that may be present. If the water is cloudy, filter it through clean cloths or coffee filters or allow it to settle. Afterwards, draw off the clear water and boil for one minute. The cooled water may be stored in clean containers with covers.
If you are unable to boil water, you can disinfect it using household bleach that contains 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite. Chlorine bleach will kill some, but not all, types of disease-causing organisms that may be in the water. Do not use scented bleaches, color-safe bleaches or bleaches with added cleaners. If the water is cloudy, filter it and use the clear water for disinfection. Add one-eighth teaspoon (or eight drops) of regular, unscented, liquid household chlorine bleach for each gallon of water (one teaspoon of bleach disinfects five gallons of water). Stir it well and let it stand for 30 minutes before use. Store the disinfected water in clean containers with covers.
Since liquid chlorine bleach loses strength over time, only fresh bleach should be used for water disinfection. For bleach that is one to two years old, the dosage should be doubled.
Another method of disinfection is to use common household iodine from the medicine chest or first-aid kit. Add five drops of 2 percent U.S. tincture of iodine to each quart or liter of clear water. For cloudy water, add ten drops and let the solution stand for at least 30 minutes.
Additional tips:
* To improve the taste or boiled or bleached-treated water, allow it to stand for several hours or aerate it by pouring from one clean container to another several times. A pinch of salt added per quart or liter will also improve the flat taste.
* Do not consume iodine-treated water if you are pregnant, iodine-sensitive or have a history of thyroid disease.
* Use bottled or boiled water for preparing powdered or concentrated infant formulas.
* Boil all tap water used for washing raw vegetables and fruit.
* Wash dishes in sink full of tap water to which one tablespoon of household bleach has been added. Air-dry the dishes before use.
* Use treated water for teeth brushing since swallowing could occur.
* Bathe or shower in untreated water but avoid contact with the mouth and eyes. Infants and toddlers should be sponge-bathed. No special soaps are necessary.
* See your family physician or healthcare provider if you become sick.
* Continue to treat water until health officials remove the boil water advisory.

WATERBORNE ILLNESSES, STRONG CURRENTS POSE RISK OF HARM
States News Service

Copyright 2010 States News Service
Length: 545 words
Byline: States News Service
Dateline: NASHVILLE, TN
Body


The following information was released by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency:
When floods occur, affected residents run the risk of contracting waterborne illnesses caused by bacteria, viruses, chemicals or toxins found in the water. People can be exposed by ingesting, breathing in, or simply contacting contaminated water. Additionally, walking, wading or even playing in flood waters might pose a potential hazard of drowning. Avoiding flood waters whenever possible is the best strategy to prevent illness and injury.
Waterborne illnesses and flood related injuries pose a serious risk to residents affected by this natural disaster, said State Health Commissioner Susan R. Cooper, MSN, RN. Parents should take extra precaution by keeping children and teens out of potentially contaminated flood waters. While it might not be obvious, currents can be strong and pose an immediate potential for drowning. Protect your loved ones and keep them safe by staying away from flood water.
Overtaxed and flooded septic and municipal wastewater systems will occasionally contaminate flood waters, increasing the risk of disease transmission. When there is risk of drinking water contamination, a boil water advisory will issued to help protect the health of a community and should be taken very seriously. These advisories tell residents how to boil or disinfect their tap water for use. For more instructions regarding drinking water advisories, visit the Web at http://www.epa.gov/safewater/faq/emerg.html. To see a list of water systems that have issued boil notices, see the Web at   http://www.tennessee.gov/environment/flood/.
Fast moving water and even shallow, standing water can pose dangers. Regardless of your ability to swim, as little as a few inches of water can cause drowning. Also, flood-related injuries or wounds can occur from contact with sharp objects such as glass or metal fragments, leading to infection that may require medical attention.
It is important to remember that during a disaster situation, personal hygiene and sanitation are critical to help prevent the spread of disease. If you must be in contact with flood water, take necessary precautions and wash thoroughly with soap and clean water afterward. Make sure to keep hands clean, which helps prevent the spread of germs. Always wash your hands with soap and clean water. Use water from an approved source or that has been boiled or disinfected. If water is not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used. People should wash their hands:
before and after preparing and eating food.
after using the toilet.
after changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.
before and after tending to someone who is sick.
after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
after handling an animal, animal waste or garbage.
before and after treating a cut or wound.
If running water is not available, a temporary hand-washing station can be created using a large water spigot jug that contains water from an approved source. If being used indoors, use a catch basin to catch the water. Also have soap, paper towels and a trash can available.
For a complete list of natural disasters and how to prepare and respond to them, please visit CDC's Web site at http://www.bt.cdc.gov/DISASTERS/.

May 4, 2010 (Blogpire Productions delivered by Newstex) --

So yesterday was an odd day working in Boston - the coffee makers were mostly silent at work. The   water main break that happened over the weekend created a boil water advisory for most of metro Boston through the workday Monday.

I saw people toting coffee makers and gallon jugs of water into work early in the day on Monday for the morning ritual. It was a little surreal. Word spread through the office of what store was serving coffee and what store wasn't. The whole morning routine was thrown for a bit as a result. The office makers that are hooked into a water line were DOA for Monday, because they would have been pulling water from the contaminated water lines. Personally, my Nespresso Essenza that I have on my desk at work had "good" water in it from Friday, and performed perfectly in the face of the minor crisis. Clean water, relatively little water used with each brew - it was good for the day.

Today's a different day - back to the routine, water ban lifted and all is well. I am bringing in some Dusao and Livanto capsules to work today for a little variety.

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau is lifting a "boil water advisory" for the Turquoise Trail Elementary School.
NMED issued the advisory on April 29, 2010 after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level for E. coli was discovered in drinking water at the school. NMED required the Turquoise Trail Elementary School to notify all water consumers of the finding.
Corrective actions were taken by the water system, including disinfecting the water system by increasing the level of chlorination and identifying possible sources of contamination. Consumers were advised to boil all water prior to ingestion.
Water samples collected since the corrective actions were taken have shown no E. coli present in the water system. These clean results have allowed NMED's Drinking Water Bureau to advise Turquoise Trail Elementary School to lift the "boil water advisory" for the water system.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 476-8638.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has rescinded a boil water advisory for the city of Roseland, which is located in Cherokee County.
KDHE issued the advisory on May 3 for the cities of Roseland and Scammon due to a break in the water main that resulted in a loss of pressure to the water distribution system. Laboratory testing on samples collected indicates no evidence of contamination, and all other conditions that place the system at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved.
The boil water advisory for the city of Scammon was rescinded May 5.

The following information was released by the office of the governor of Kentucky:
Federal emergency teams joined local and state officials in several counties today to begin estimating damages from last weekend's devastating storms and flooding.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel arrived in Frankfort yesterday for briefings with the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management (KyEM) officials. County damage assessments began this morning.
These assessments are a critical part of the process to organize recovery and for getting the federal assistance we need, said Governor Steve Beshear. I strongly encourage citizens to cooperate with the teams. Canvassing our state to estimate the extensive damage will be an arduous task, and I appreciate the efforts of FEMA and our local emergency officials.
FEMA assessors visited affected counties with personnel from local emergency management, local elected officials, KyEM, Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, Kentucky Department of Public Health and the Kentucky National Guard. As each county assessment is completed, teams will be reassigned to new counties and work will continue over the weekend. Teams will review the storms' impact on both government property and individual citizens.
This is a complicated task, the scope and widespread damage is creating a challenge for us to get to all the impacted counties at once, said John Heltzel, director of the KyEM. Let me assure you; if you have not seen these teams in your counties, you will.
Officials encourage those who have suffered property damage to photograph the damage, save any repair receipts and report damage to the local emergency management director.
Monitoring Lake Levels
Emergency personnel continue to watch the basin of the lower Ohio River and lake levels and continue working closely with local, state and federal officials to prepare for flooding as a result of the high waters.
Residents should be aware that lake releases are necessary to guard against damaging the dams and to control lake levels.
KyEM, the Kentucky Division of Water and United States Army Corps of Engineers, as well as other state and local emergency officials, continue to monitor water levels behind all dams and levees across the Commonwealth.
Residents can get more information about rising waters by visiting the KyEM website at www.kyem.ky.gov or the USACE at   www.lrl.usace.army.mil.
Body of Kayaker Recovered
The Hart County coroner has confirmed the recovery of the body of a missing kayaker who disappeared in the Green River earlier this week. This brings the fatality count to five deaths associated with this storm.
I am saddened by the news of another fatality due to the storm, and my thoughts are with the friends and family, said Gov. Beshear. This latest loss of life is a reminder that people must avoid entering floodwaters they are swift and dangerous.
Pulaski County officials continue to search for a missing 18-year-old kayaker.
Storm Numbers:
79 counties and 36 cities have declared States of Emergency
5 confirmed fatalities
Nearly 80 National Guard soldiers are on the ground assisting local officials
25 boil water advisories (BWA) affecting approximately 83,000 Kentuckians
500 well disinfection kits prepared for distribution
Turn Around, Don't Drown
Do not drive through or wade through any water, no matter if it's just a few inches. Stop, turn around - don't drown. Do not venture onto flooded waterways for recreation. If you must travel by boat, for whatever reason, wear a personal flotation device.
Water Safety
The Kentucky Division of Water reports that, while most drinking water systems are up and running, boil water advisories are in effect for some areas due to broken lines and other factors. Check with your local government or public works officials for current boil water advisory status.
The division also warns against contact with floodwaters due to contamination from sewage, agricultural products and other harmful substances.
Citizens should be advised that water contaminated in one part of the state travels through fast-flowing rivers and streams to other areas, causing widespread bacterial contamination. If you should come into contact with floodwater, immediately wash the affected areas with hot water and antibacterial soap.
Road Repairs
More roads are reopening as conditions improve. Highway crews are continuing to repair pavement breaks, culvert failures, embankment erosion, guardrail and other flood-related damage statewide. For a list of road closings, and conditions, across the Commonwealth, visit www.511.ky.gov

About 50 homes in Mt. Lebanon lost water service yesterday morning when a private contractor operating an excavator at a house struck a water main around 10 a.m., a water utility spokeswoman said.
Josephine Posti, spokeswoman for Pennsylvania American Water, said the main was damaged on Pinewood Drive, but most of the affected customers live on Arrowood.
Pennsylvania American expected to have water restored yesterday evening and was issuing boil-water advisories for the homes affected by the outage.

OHIO
House fire kills girl, 1, in eastern Ohio
A fire that apparently spread quickly through a house in eastern Ohio has killed a 1-year-old girl.
The Jefferson County coroner's office says Savannah Creamer died in the fire in the house near Mingo Junction around 9:30 a.m. Sunday.
Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said he has reason to believe a 4-year-old in the house might have been playing with matches before the fire. Sheriff Abdalla said the 4-year-old came out of a bathroom and said there was a fire. He said the investigation is continuing.
Deborah Welsch, the coroner's office chief investigator, says it appears the 1-year-old girl died of smoke inhalation after becoming trapped in the house.
Ms. Welsch says the girl's parents and six other children got out of the house, but two children were injured when they fell or jumped out of windows. Sheriff Abdalla said one of the children who fell or jumped was taken to a Pittsburgh hospital.
Ms. Welsch says the initial call referred to a room on fire, but firefighters arrived to find the entire house ablaze.
ALLEGHENY COUNTY
Most power restored after Saturday's winds
Overnight restoration work reduced the impact of Saturday's power outages that were caused by high winds that tore through the region.
As of 6 p.m. Sunday, Duquesne Light was reporting that 150 customers were still without service, down from a peak of 9,200 Saturday afternoon.
Allegheny Energy reported that service was restored to virtually all customers in Pennsylvania as of Sunday evening, down from about 13,000 in Pennsylvania on Saturday.
Throughout the company's four-state territory, some 35,000 customers were without service Saturday and all but 160 were restored as of Sunday evening, said spokesman Jeffrey Straight. Outages were widespread, he said, but were concentrated Saturday in Pittsburgh and New Stanton.
Duquesne Light outages were concentrated in Penn Hills, Baldwin, West Mifflin, Aleppo, Hampton, Leet, Moon, Ross and Shaler.

Police arrest suspect in Homewood slaying
A Homewood man was arrested Sunday and charge with fatally shooting an East Liberty man early Saturday inside a home on North Murtland Avenue in Homewood, police said.
Virgil Williams 34, has been charged with homicide in the killing of Michael Garnett Jr., 19, who was shot at 2:40 a.m. Saturday and was pronounced dead at 8:14 a.m. at UPMC Presbyterian.
Mr. Williams is in the Allegheny County Jail and faces a hearing May 14, police said.
Point Park U. gets gift, matching grant
The Richard King Mellon Foundation has donated $2 million outright to Point Park University's new student and convocation center and pledged a $2 million matching award toward the project, the university said Thursday.
To receive the full $2 million match, Point Park will have to raise $2 million of its own through donations, university spokeswoman Mary Ellen Solomon said. She declined to say how much Point Park has thus far raised.
If the $2 million match is triggered in full, it, combined with the $2 million foundation grant in hand, would constitute the largest gift by an individual or foundation in Point Park's history. The money will help the university of nearly 4,000 students establish its center in the former YMCA building at 330 Blvd. of the Allies, Downtown.
"The Student and Convocation Center will become the hub of our campus and student activities," Point Park President Paul Hennigan said in a statement. "The support of the Richard King Mellon Foundation is critical to our success in providing academic and recreational spaces for our students and an amenity for the Downtown community."
Group hopes to build memorial to fallen officers
A group raising money to build a permanent memorial to three slain Pittsburgh police officers hopes to win a $50,000 grant through the Pepsi soft drink company with the help of online voters.
The Bloomfield Development Corp. needs about that much money to complete a $116,000 statue and memorial garden outside St. Joseph Church on Liberty Avenue to honor fallen Officers Paul J. Sciullo II, Eric G. Kelly, and Stephen Mayhle.
"It's just a matter of everybody voting," said Executive Director Karla Owens. "It's a really great program."
Pepsi awards grants based on how many votes a project receives online. The competition is nationwide and voting continues through May at www.refresheverything.com. The project's title is "I want to build a memorial garden for fallen police officers."

Water main broken in Mt. Lebanon
A water main break in Mt. Lebanon disrupted service to about 50 customers when a private plumbing contractor broke an eight-inch main line Sunday, said Josephine Posti, a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania American Water. The main is located on Pinewood Drive.
Initially, it was feared that about 10 homes had sustained some level of damage but Ms. Posti said it appeared Sunday that only one or two homes were impacted by the break.
Emergency responders were called at 9:30 a.m. and cleared the scene within an hour, according to an emergency dispatch supervisor.
Ms. Posti said the break was repaired Sunday afternoon but a boil-water advisory remains in effect for affected customers.

Mount Joy Issues Boil Water Alert

Mount Joy Borough water customers were alerted to boil water Monday night after a contractor damaged a water main pipe that runs across the Chiques Creek.
The alert came from the borough water authority's emergency phone system, which was used for the first time in the emergency.
The Swift Reach Network was able to contact residents within 15 minutes of the break.
Terry Kauffman, borough special projects manager, said Tuesday that 33 residential units were affected, but at one point every customer was without water. About six properties were without water for several hours.
The water system lost pressure and, under state Department of Environmental Protection policy, the municipality was required to issue a boil water alert. The danger is that the water can become contaminated with bacteria such as E. coli.
The borough conducted the first bacterial test on Tuesday for possible contamination and is waiting for lab results. A second test will be done Thursday. If both tests are negative, the boil water advisory can be lifted.
"We need to do the precautionary tests to see that it is OK before we can tell (residents) it's OK to drink. That's established by the DEP," Kauffman said.
More precaution is needed with this break because of its proximity to the Chiques Creek. It is a trout stream, and the borough has to avoid contamination.
"The contractor hit a little pipe that crossed the Chiques Creek near Manheim Road. It went back to the 1940s, not on any maps. No one knew it was there," Kauffman said. "You try to keep track of them but no one knew. I really can't say anyone is at fault."
The borough has dug a hole by the stream and is pumping it out to keep the water from draining into the creek.
When the boil water ban is lifted, the borough will again notify the public using the direct call system.

Markey: Our Country's Aging Water Infrastructure Needs An Upgrade

Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass. (7th CD), issued the following news release:
Representative Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee today released the following prepared remarks at a hearing on the Assistance, Quality and Affordability Act of 2010:
"When people turn on their bathroom or kitchen faucets they often take for granted that an abundant supply of clean water flows freely from their taps. It is only when the water stops flowing due to a catastrophic failure that attention is given to the complexities of providing clean, safe drinking water.
"A prime example of such a catastrophic failure occurred just over a week ago in Massachusetts, when a breach in a seven year old pipe caused a water supply emergency that affected over 2 million residents of Boston and its surrounding areas, including a large portion of my district.
"A boil-water advisory lasted for several days. People swarmed the Stop and Shop and other grocery stores to stock up on bottled water. Restaurants and diners had to close because they had no water to serve or wash dishes with. And people had to get through Monday without their morning cup of Dunkin' Donuts-which resulted in a near riot at the Dunkin' Donuts across from my District Office in Medford Square. In the Boston papers, the entire incident became know as the Aqua-pocalypse.
"Although the MWRA incident could not have been anticipated because the pipe that broke was so new, public attention immediately turned to the need for increased federal funding for infrastructure projects that ensure a safe drinking water supply for years to come.
"The reality is that the country's drinking water infrastructure is rapidly aging. EPA estimates that over the next 20 years, water systems will need to invest nearly $335 billion dollars on infrastructure improvements to ensure safe water to our nation. Water systems simply can't afford to do this on their own, and people who are already struggling to pay their water bills can't absorb these costs either. We cannot turn off the flow of federal funding for this essential infrastructure at a time when our water systems need it most.
"The Assistance, Quality, and Affordability Act that Chairman Waxman and I have introduced will reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Fund for the first time since its creation in 1996 and will make a number of changes to invest in our future.
"The bill increases water project funding from $1.5 billion dollars in 2011 to $6 billion dollars in 2015. This will mean that more drinking water projects can be completed, and that more jobs are created for people who need them. A December 2008 report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors estimated that every million dollars of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure investment directly creates 8.7 jobs. Over the next 5 years, our legislation would therefore lead to more than 100,000 new jobs.
"We have also included a new emphasis on cutting-edge projects to allow funding priority to be granted for projects that will make drinking water safe and affordable for years to come. We will also encourage projects that increase water and energy efficiency, and projects that anticipate future problems and propose repairs before a crisis occurs.
"We've ensured that we are directing resources to those who need it most, so that water systems serving communities that can't afford to pay for the upgrades necessary to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act standards are given what they need to do so.
"We've also included a change in drinking water enforcement requirements that will ensure that systems that have violated drinking water standards in the past are inspected to ensure they stay compliant. I would like to thank Congressman Bobby Rush for his work in this area, following a truly horrific case in the village of Crestwood, Illinois in which people were literally and knowingly poisoned by the water they were drinking for decades.
"Finally, this bill also includes my language to strengthen EPA's endocrine disruptor screening program. Endocrine disrupting chemicals are like computer viruses that, over time, can severely disrupt your body's operating system, and it is vital that EPA have a more robust and transparent program that screens drinking water contaminants to identify the chemicals that pose such concerns.
"I thank the witnesses for attending today's hearing. We look forward to your testimony."

The reality is that the countrys drinking water infrastructure is rapidly aging. EPA estimates that over the next 20 years, water systems will need to invest nearly $335 billion dollars on infrastructure improvements to ensure safe water to our nation. Water systems simply cant afford to do this on their own, and people who are already struggling to pay their water bills cant absorb these costs either. We cannot turn off the flow of federal funding for this essential infrastructure at a time when our water systems need it most.
The Assistance, Quality, and Affordability Act that Chairman Waxman and I have introduced will reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Fund for the first time since its creation in 1996 and will make a number of changes to invest in our future.
The bill increases water project funding from $1.5 billion dollars in 2011 to $6 billion dollars in 2015. This will mean that more drinking water projects can be completed, and that more jobs are created for people who need them. A December 2008 report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors estimated that every million dollars of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure investment directly creates 8.7 jobs. Over the next 5 years, our legislation would therefore lead to more than 100,000 new jobs.
We have also included a new emphasis on cutting-edge projects to allow funding priority to be granted for projects that will make drinking water safe and affordable for years to come. We will also encourage projects that increase water and energy efficiency, and projects that anticipate future problems and propose repairs before a crisis occurs.
Weve ensured that we are directing resources to those who need it most, so that water systems serving communities that cant afford to pay for the upgrades necessary to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act standards are given what they need to do so.
Weve also included a change in drinking water enforcement requirements that will ensure that systems that have violated drinking water standards in the past are inspected to ensure they stay compliant. I would like to thank Congressman Bobby Rush for his work in this area, following a truly horrific case in the village of Crestwood, Illinois in which people were literally and knowingly poisoned by the water they were drinking for decades.
Finally, this bill also includes my language to strengthen EPAs endocrine disruptor screening program. Endocrine disrupting chemicals are like computer viruses that, over time, can severely disrupt your bodys operating system, and it is vital that EPA have a more robust and transparent program that screens drinking water contaminants to identify the chemicals that pose such concerns.
I thank the witnesses for attending todays hearing. We look forward to your testimony.

Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass. (7th CD), issued the following news release:
Representative Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee today released the following prepared remarks at a hearing on the Assistance, Quality and Affordability Act of 2010:
"When people turn on their bathroom or kitchen faucets they often take for granted that an abundant supply of clean water flows freely from their taps. It is only when the water stops flowing due to a catastrophic failure that attention is given to the complexities of providing clean, safe drinking water.
"A prime example of such a catastrophic failure occurred just over a week ago in Massachusetts, when a breach in a seven year old pipe caused a water supply emergency that affected over 2 million residents of Boston and its surrounding areas, including a large portion of my district.
"A boil-water advisory lasted for several days. People swarmed the Stop and Shop and other grocery stores to stock up on bottled water. Restaurants and diners had to close because they had no water to serve or wash dishes with. And people had to get through Monday without their morning cup of Dunkin' Donuts-which resulted in a near riot at the Dunkin' Donuts across from my District Office in Medford Square. In the Boston papers, the entire incident became know as the Aqua-pocalypse.
"Although the MWRA incident could not have been anticipated because the pipe that broke was so new, public attention immediately turned to the need for increased federal funding for infrastructure projects that ensure a safe drinking water supply for years to come.

The Louisville Water Company has issued a boil water advisory for about 1,000 customers in southern Jefferson County.
A news release Monday morning stated the advisory is a precaution after pressure dropped in two elevated storage tanks.
The utility advised affected customers to boil all water used for drinking and cooking for three minutes.
Those customers also should not use chilled water from refrigerators or ice dispensers.
The affected area is within a boundary of East Pages Lane, St. Andrews Church Road and Third Street Road.

Car hits hydrant; water main broken in city

May 19--A vehicle crashed into and snapped a fire hydrant near the McCann School of Business & Technology Pottsville campus and broke a water main Tuesday night, according to Pottsville fire Chief Todd March.
Schuylkill County Municipal Authority issued a water boil advisory, according to Patrick M. Caulfield, authority executive director.
Caulfield said customers in the City of Pottsville, from 12th Street west to Westwood Road and Route 901, and in Norwegian Township, including Bull's Head and Seltzer, should boil their water for a minimum of 1 minute before drinking.
"As a precaution, the authority has issued a boil-water advisory for the entire Indian Run System ... Should all tests indicate that there is no contamination, the boil water advisory may be lifted as early as (Thursday)," Caulfield said Tuesday night.
The incident occurred just before 9 p.m.
"A car hit a hydrant in the parking lot and snapped it off at the base where it goes into the water main. It's a fairly large main, like an 8-inch main goes down through there. It feeds the whole west end," March said.
City police were not able to provide further details about the crash Tuesday night.
The impact zone stretched all the way to the area of 14th and Laurel Boulevard, where March said an automatic fire alarm went off because of low water pressure to a sprinkler system.
Municipal authority workers were able to control the leak by 9:55 p.m.
"Pressure was restored after the hydrant was shut off, however, some customers may experience discolored water," Caulfield said.
Caulfield said anyone with questions should call the authority at 622-8240.

Boil Advisory Issued for Swea City

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources issued the following news release:
A major water main break at Swea City in Kossuth County has prompted a boil advisory for that community.
The water main break resulted in the entire tower draining Thursday night. Since there is no water pressure in the system until the repairs can be made, a boil advisory is in effect until the system is restored and the necessary testing can take place to make sure the water is safe. It is anticipated that water pressure could be restored today, but the boil advisory will remain in affect until the entire system can be chlorinated, flush and tested to ensure there is no bacterial contamination in the system.
The city is working on arrangements to provide bottled water to residents until all of the repairs and testing have occurred.
It is recommended not to drink the water without boiling it first. Bring all water to a boil, let it boil for one minute, and let it cool before using, or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, and food preparation until further notice. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. The water may be used for bathing and other similar purposes. More information on disinfecting water is available on the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791.

Some in western Mon still without water: Clay-Battelle PSD working on leaks

Jun. 8--A few Clay-Battelle Public Service District (PSD) customers continued to experience water problems in the Wadestown area Monday, two weeks after leaks were reported. Approximately five households in the higher elevations of Wadestown had little or no water, according to the PSD.
Three hundred households were initially affected in the Wadestown, Bula, Wana, Crossroads and upper Blue Goose areas.
Public Service District billing manager Linda Chisler said that the West Virginia Rural Association has been hired to work on resolving the remaining customers' difficulties by shutting off the valves, walking the water lines and searching for seeping water.
The association discovered a 20-foot long crack in a pipeline, which was repaired May 26.
A boil water advisory was lifted June 3, she said. The advisory, which is dictated by the state Health Department, was a preventive measure to check if there were any contaminants in the residents' drinking water.
Although the majority of residents now have water in Wadestown, "People were using creek water to shower in," Bedo Gorosdieda, who is an employee of the Wadestown Service Station, said. "We didn't have water here for three or four days."
Clay-Battelle PSD serves 1,630 households and has 110 miles of water lines.
"We're trying to get this fixed as soon as possible," Chisler said. "It takes a while for the water to build back up, even after it's fixed, especially with people filling their pools, as well as the two coal mines in the area that are pulling a lot of the water."

The state Department of Health and the Green Tank Irrigation District 11 advise residents served by Green Tank to boil their tap water or buy bottled water until further notice. Potentially harmful bacteria have been detected in the water system.
The advisory affects about 170 homes and businesses served by Green Tank. The district's service area is generally north of College Place and west of Walla Walla (http://wallawallagis.com/PDFS/MAPS/WATER_SERVICE_AREAS/GREEN%20TANK%20IRRIGATION%20DISTRICT.pdf).
E. coli was detected in routine water samples. The state health Office of Drinking Water is working closely with the water system's operator to pinpoint the source of contamination and fix the problem. It may be tied to pump failures that occurred last week.
The health advisory includes several precautionary steps customers should take. Use boiled water or bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth, preparing food, dishwashing, and making ice. Tap water should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before use.
While there have been no reports of illness associated with this contamination event, the advisory will remain in effect until the water system operator and the state health agency are satisfied there is no longer a health threat to the system's customers.
Customers who have questions should call Green Tank Irrigation District at 509-525-4608, or Walla Walla County Health District (Barry Jenkins or Jeanette Lightfoot) at 509-524-2662.

"Precautionary Boil Water Advisory" door signs were placed on the businesses/residences so as to inform the customers of this situation and to provide contact information. Larger signs were placed at specific intersections within the service area.
Therefore, as a precaution, we advise that all water used for drinking, cooking, making ice, brushing teeth, or washing dishes be boiled. A rolling boil of one minute is sufficient. As an alternative bottled water may be used.
This "Precautionary Boil Water Notice" will remain in effect until the problem has been corrected and bacteriological survey shows that the water is safe to drink.
If you have any questions you may contact Seminole County Environmental Services Department at 407.665.2110 between the hours of 8:00am - 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, or call 407.665.2767 all other hours.

Jun. 12--Muhlenberg County is getting a new warning system that can contact local residents using home phones, cell phones, text messages and e-mails to warn them about bad weather or other potential problems.
Central City Mayor Barry Shaver said the city's council voted Wednesday to proceed with a contract with CodeRED, a Louisville company that supplies the warning system. Originally, Central City was going to pay $9,000 per year for the system, which would accommodate two phone lines -- cell or landline -- per household, plus text and e-mail addresses.
However, on Thursday, Muhlenberg County Fiscal Court voted to adopt the system for the entire county for a year to try it out. The county will pay $22,500 per year, Judge-Executive Rick Newman said.
"We've had all these disasters, and we've lost some lives," Newman said, referring to the January 2009 ice storm and the Powderly tornado in February 2008. "We felt like it's worth giving it a shot, at least for a year, to see how it's going to work."
Shaver said the system will provide another line of communication to residents.
"This is just going to give us a little more advanced warning," Shaver said. "After people go to bed, things happen at night. How are they going to know about it? This CodeRED will call them on their landline or cell phone and let them know."
Shaver said the system can dial specific sections of the city and county, which might be helpful in the case of a boil-water advisory or power outage.
"It's a great communications tool," Shaver said. "I can't see why anyone wouldn't be enthused about this."
Newman said it will be up to residents to take advantage of the system.
"It's a voluntary thing. If you don't want to be on that list, you don't have to be on it, and you can determine what you want to be called about," Newman said. "If enough percentage of the citizens of Muhlenberg County don't want to participate, it won't be worth doing. We feel it's worth a shot."
Newman said the system should be operational by Aug. 1 and a media blitz will follow, educating residents about the system and how they can sign up.
"When you can get any kind of advanced warning at all, that can save lives," Shaver said. "We can't control the weather, but when we can have a little heads up, it sure does help. In critical times, seconds count."

A new warning system in Muhlenberg County would contact residents by home phone, cell phone, text message and e-mails about bad weather or other potential problems.
The county's fiscal court voted Thursday to adopt the system for a trial year at a cost of $22,500.
Judge-Executive Rick Newman told the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer that given recent disasters like the January 2009 ice storm and a tornado in February 2008, they felt like it was worth trying out the system.
CodeRED, a Louisville company, supplies the warning system, which Newman said should be operational by Aug. 1.
Central City Mayor Barry Shaver said the system could help to alert people during the night or can be specific to certain sections of the city and county, which would be helpful during power outages or boil water advisories.

The following information was released by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources:
Residents of Adair are being advised to use only bottled water for consumption until a broken water main can be repaired.

Retailers within Adair are working with the county emergency management office to increase bottled water supplies until the advisory is lifted.
Residents are also being urged to conserve water usage as the city tries to maintain water pressure in its system utilizing the water being brought in from other communities.
Adair is attempting to locate the break and will be repairing the water main. After the repairs, the city will flush the lines and collect bacteria samples. Additional flushing may need to be conducted. This advisory is a precaution until bacterial sample results are available. The public will be notified when the results are available and the advisory is lifted.

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and Saline County RWD #7 are issuing a boil water advisory for the water customers of the Saline County RWD #7 water system, located in southwest Saline County. Customers of Saline County RWD #1 are not affected by this advisory.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory in advance of repairs that are scheduled to be made between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM on Monday, June 14, 2010. During this time, a valve will be replaced which will cause an interruption of water service resulting in little or no water pressure. Whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) levels are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
Water customers should consider filling sanitary containers with tap water, or obtaining bottled water for consumption until the advisory has been lifted. When water service is restored, residents served by the affected public water systems should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
Questions regarding the status of this advisory may be directed to Bruce Spare by calling (785) 667-6903. The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded.

An advisory to use bottled water is expected to last for the remainder of the week in Adair, and possibly into next week. Residents of Adair are being advised to use only bottled water for consumption until a broken water main can be repaired and the system can be flushed and tested for any potential contamination.
An advisory to boil and conserve water was issued Sunday evening after a water main going from the city's well to its water treatment plant malfunctioned. The problem was identified on Monday as a faulty valve that allowed water to be pumped from one well into another rather than to the water treatment plant.
Since water was being brought in from surrounding communities in fire trucks, residents have been urged to use bottled water as an extra precaution against potential water contamination. The wells are now bringing water into the plant, but until it can be determined that all of the water from the fire trucks has been flushed from the system and the necessary testing can be done, residents are still being urged to use bottled water.
Retailers within Adair are working with the county emergency management office to increase bottled water supplies until the advisory is lifted.
Residents are also being urged to continue conserving water which will allow the tower to fill faster and the necessary testing to be done sooner.

Algoma U Students: 'First Nations Water Bill is Leaky'

Algoma University issued the following news release:
Students at Algoma University have responded to the proposed First Nations Water Legislation (Bill S-11), saying that while the efforts are long overdue, it is a small step in the right direction, with more work needed for the bill to carry any long term viability.
"It's concerning that the bill will create legislation, but will fail to implement adequate skills training and resources to First Nations communities to meet the regulations" says Katie Yakasovich, Vice-President External of the Algoma University Students Union (AUSU). "It's also disheartening that the government would spend $1.9 Million to create a fake lake in Downtown Toronto, but will not invest in the health and sustainability of our communities."
AUSU, in solidarity with the Shingwauk Anishnaabe Students Association (SASA) continue to work towards enlightening the federal government on the issues with the over 120 First Nations communities that do not have access to clean drinking water.
Algoma U Graduate Joanne Robertson and supporters are actively working on the Empty Glass for Water campaign, to raise awareness with the Federal government that the number of water advisories is a problem that only the federal government working with our First Nations leaders can address. "Bill S-11 provides no guarantees that drinking water infrastructure will be improved in our communities. One in six of our communities is on a boil water advisory." says Robertson.
"We have support from across Canada to continue the efforts to ensure fair access to resources," Yakasovich says. "Over 600,000 students have endorsed the campaign, and we will take that support to the next level as we force the decision-makers to be accountable, and ensure our message is heard. This was an issue that was raised when Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff was here for a town hall meeting. We need Ottawa to understand that leaving communities behind is never an option. The electorate will not have it."
Algoma University students and people from across the country are encouraged to collect empty glasses to send to the Prime Minister's office to send the message, and promote all communities to send an empty glass with a message to the Prime Minister, asking for fair access to a safe, clean drinking water.

(Afghan-Cda-Soldier) (Audio: 135)
Another sad day for Canadian troops in Afghanistan.
One of their own was killed by an improvised explosive device.
Sergeant James MacNeil of Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, who was on his fourth tour of Afghanistan, was killed while on foot patrol.
Brigadier-General Jonathan Vance says he was very well-liked by his comrades and was trying to make Afghanistan a safer place.
Since the Afghan mission began in 2002, 148 Canadian military personnel have been killed. (18)
(G-20-CSIS-Terrorism)
Terrorism does not seem to be the biggest concern for this week's G-8 and G-20 summits in Huntsville, Ontario and Toronto.
Richard Fadden, who heads the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, tells C-B-C's The National in an interview airing tonight that intelligence suggests a terrorist attack is unlikely.
While downplaying the threat of terrorism, Fadden says intelligence chatter does suggest that ''anarchist groups'' and ''multi-issue extremists'' are getting ready for action as world leaders meet. (18)
(Edmonton House Explosion) (Audio: 99)
Homicide detectives are investigating a powerful blast that killed four people and forced dozens from their homes in north Edmonton.
The explosion, yesterday afternoon, destroyed one house and seriously damaged many others in the neighbourhood.
Acting Police Chief Darryl DaCosta says there's no indication that the blast was caused by an explosive device or chemicals in a drug lab.
He says officers suspect some kind of criminal activity. (18)
(Prairies-Rain) (Audio:142)
The southern Alberta communities of Fort Macleod and Raymond are under boil-water advisories because of all the rain and flooding.
Fort Macleod Mayor Shawn Patience says it will likely remain in effect for several weeks.
The amount of rain that fell in Medicine Hat today was less than forecast and Fire Chief Ron Robinson says people are relieved.
Saskatchewan's agriculture minister Jack Hayden says much of the province's crops are under water and the province will do all it can to assist those impacted by the flooding. (18)
(US-Times-Square-Car-Bomb) (Audio: 149)
The so-called Times Square bomber has pleaded guilty.
No apologies from Faisal Shahzad (FY'-sul shah-ZAHD') who says he actually tried to set off three separate bombs in an S-U-V parked near a Broadway theatre May 1st.
They all failed to ignite.
The Bridgeport, Connecticut, resident was arrested two days later.
He says he was trained by the Pakistan Taliban in Pakistan in late December and early January before returning to the U-S.
He will be sentenced on October 5th. (18)
(Go-Slow-Day) (Audio: 143)
This is the first day of summer and it's International Slowness Day -- a time to take a deep breath and relax.
The ''Take it Easy'' movement began in 2001, when Francois Gourd and some friends in Montreal, decided to gather in a city park, relax, and enjoy art, music and yoga.
He says people don't take enough time to slow down. (18)

The amount of rain that fell in Medicine Hat today was less than forecast and Fire Chief Ron Robinson says people are relieved.
Saskatchewan's agriculture minister Jack Hayden says much of the province's crops are under water and the province will do all it can to assist those impacted by the flooding. (18)

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources issued the following news release:
A bottled water and conservation advisory for the city of Adair has been lifted.
Testing of the repaired system after it had been flushed indicates no bacteria in the water meaning residents can once again use tap water for drinking and cooking.
A boil and conservation advisory was issued Sunday, June 13th when water from the well was not reaching the water treatment plant. The problem was identified on Monday as a faulty valve that allowed water to be pumped from one well into another rather than to the water treatment plant.
The bottled water advisory was issued on Monday because fire trucks from neighboring communities had been used to pump water into the system to maintain water pressure. Using bottled water was advised as an extra precaution in protecting the health of Adair residents.

The city of Columbia issued the following news release:
Two consecutive days of laboratory tests confirm that the water for customers living in the northern sections of Columbia is safe to drink. Columbia Water and Light had issued the precautionary boil advisory after a large water distribution main broke on Tuesday, June 22. The areas that were under a precautionary boil advisory were: Lake of the Woods, Mexico Gravel Road, Pine Grove Mobile Home Park, Godas, The Links, Hanover, Timber Ridge, Garden City, Indian Hills and the surrounding subdivisions.
The main break caused the water pressure to drop substantially which could have led to contamination. According to standards set by the Department of Natural Resources, Columbia Water & Light issued a precautionary water boil order. The water samples from the repaired water lines required an incubation period of 24 hours before they could be analyzed. Both sets of samples showed no bacterial contamination.
Customers will be notified by an automatic phone system that the water is safe to drink. Customers who do not receive a phone call should contact the Utility Customer Service office at (573) 874-7380 to make sure the correct phone number is on file. Customers can also update their utility account contact information at www.GoColumbiaMo.com.

Waterworks getting temporary water supply after main break

Temporary water service will be installed later this afternoon at the Waterworks mall near Aspinwall, where water has been cut off since late last night due to a break in a water main in nearby Aspinwall.
"We are trying to get some temporary water service, a temporary line," said Mara Mrvos, a spokeswoman for the J.J. Gumberg Co. of Braddock Hills, which owns the mall.
Water was shut off during repairs since late last night. Except for Subway and Caribou Coffee, all of the mall's restaurants are closed. The mall's retail shops, including Giant Eagle, are all open.
"Overall, business at the mall seems to be fairly normal, although, obviously, not at the restaurants," Mrvos said.
About 1,500 Aspinwall homes have been placed under a boil water advisory, said Ed Warchol, the borough's manager.

Water main break forces most Waterworks eateries to close

Ice cream was for sale at Cold Stone Creamery in The Waterworks mall near Aspinwall, but there were no shakes, iced coffee or smoothies.
The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority cut water service to the mall's 54 tenants on Thursday so a 60-inch water transmission line could be repaired. It provided temporary service from a fire hydrant, but issued a "boil water" advisory.
"It was slow this morning because people assumed we were closed. But it has picked up," said Coldstone's owner, Sharon Chepelsky, who spent about $25 on bottled water for her employees to drink or to use for washing their hands.
Cold Stone Creamery and Subway were the only food establishments open at The Waterworks, where the break on Wednesday at Second Street and Delafield Avenue in Aspinwall flooded streets and kept a nearby section of Freeport Road closed for hours.
The authority was able to restore regular water service after the break, but then shut it off for the repairs. It hopes to have them completed by noon today, said Melissa Rubin, spokeswoman for the authority.
UPMC St Margaret, which lost water briefly Wednesday, used an alternate feed from Aspinwall for its water supply yesterday, said Jim Harkins, director of facility services at the hospital.
"We are using bottled water for drinking and hand-washing," he said.
At The Waterworks, most retailers were able to get by with bottled water and portable toilets.
"Overall, business at the mall seems to be fairly normal, although, obviously, not at the restaurants," said Mara Mrvos, a spokeswoman for the J.J. Gumberg Co. of Braddock Hills, which owns the mall.
About 1,500 customers in Aspinwall were under a boil water advisory yesterday, said Ed Warchol, the borough's manager.
Subway remained open, said owner Honey Sahni, because food preparation requires little washing of kitchen utensils and equipment. Sahni spent $100 on bottled water for hand washing and drinking
"We knew it would be busy. We stayed open because most of the other places are not able to," Sahni said.
At the Sport Clips salon, only the most basic of haircuts were available. It could not offer shampoos, for instance.
"It was a slow day and was really bad yesterday too," said Linda Plyler, assistant manager.
Stores such as Wal-Mart and Giant Eagle were able to stay open, but had to install portable toilets.
"There was very little disruption at the Giant Eagle. There was a bit less prepared food, but that was about the only difference," said Dick Roberts, a Giant Eagle spokesman.

Union ratifies contract with Giant Eagle
Local 23 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union has ratified a four-year contract with Giant Eagle.
The agreement, ratified by the union Friday by a margin of 5 to 1, covers about 5,800 workers in Allegheny, Washington and Westmoreland counties and Monongalia County in West Virginia.
It includes pay increases and improved health care benefits, according to the company.
Jim D'Alessandro, a Giant Eagle meat cutter and bargaining team member, said he was pleased with the agreement.
"Wage increases will up the standard of living for our members, the improvements to the health plan mean members will be able to take their kids to the doctors when they need to go, and we have secured the pension so they don't have to worry about living in abject poverty after a lifetime of work," he stated.
Daniel Shapira, special counsel for Giant Eagle, said, "The agreement provides attractive enhancements in wages and health care benefits, which is particularly remarkable in the current economic climate."

Water main repairs wrap up in Aspinwall
Work on Aspinwall's big water main break has been completed.
The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority reported Saturday that workers had repaired the break in a 60-inch water main that flooded parts of Freeport Road and left the area without water beginning at mid-afternoon on Tuesday.
PWSA spokeswoman Melissa Rubin said the leak was repaired by 10 Saturday morning.
Nevertheless, a boil-water advisory remains in effect for the Waterworks Mall and its customers. Ms. Rubin said a second round of tests needs to be done on water there before it can be declared safe for cooking and drinking.
The boil-water advisory for Aspinwall has been lifted by borough officials, meaning townsfolk can resume regular water use, she said.

Penn Taps Manheim For Water; Flushing, Portable Filter Units Planned

About 100 residents attended Penn Township supervisors meeting Monday night at Manheim Central Middle School after the township's water supply tested positive for the parasite cryptosporidium.
David Sarley, supervisor chairman, told them, "There's not going to be a magic wand waved tonight. We have to clear out the water in Penn Township and then (undergo) testing by the (state) Department of Environmental Protection. There will be a fix but not a quick fix."
The township issued a boil-water advisory on Friday. On Monday, Penn began installation of an emergency connection to the public water supply of Manheim Borough. The work is expected to be completed today.
"The whole system is already infected. As soon as you open the (water) tower, you're going to infect your entire system," Don Gibble, a resident, said.
"We're going to do the best that we can to flush the system," said Mike Wolgemuth, an employee of Severn Trent. The firm monitors the township's water and wastewater operations. "That's why the DEP will require us to keep the boil-water advisory for several days."
The township will drain the 500,000-gallon water tank and flush the lines through the fire hydrants, then refill the tank and system with water from the borough.
"Once you have flushed out the main system, what do you have to do to our homes?" resident Linda Landis asked.
After the water tank is refilled, township engineer Dan Becker said, residents will have to run their faucets and flush their toilets, but he could not give specific guidelines.
Officials said the township's bimonthly tests for cryptosporidium since November 2009 were all negative. What prompted the testing beginning June 14 was an increase in the cloudiness or turbidity of the water, which can decrease chlorine effectiveness. Tests were done daily, and the water was tested for turbidity, chlorine levels and bacteria. No bacteria, including E. coli, were found.
Dave Kratzer, township manager, said, "We are as perplexed as you are. We have been doing regular cryptosporidium testing. It was something that happened that caused this issue."
Kratzer said before the meeting that the township was looking at the formation of two sinkholes on the Kreider farm in Manheim as the potential source of the cryptosporidium contamination.
The township's only well is along Doe Run Road and adjacent to the Kreider farm.
Cryptosporidium comes from bovine feces and is found in surface water. When the sinkholes formed, the surface water possibly came into contact with the ground water that supplies the well.
Cryptosporidium is unaffected by chlorine and can only be removed by filtration or destroyed by high temperatures. It causes intestinal symptoms and can be dangerous for people who have a weak immune system.
Manheim Borough's water is filtered as well as treated with chlorine.
Kratzer said the township has completed a feasibility study required by DEP for a permanent, $2 million filtration system that is expected to be operational in 2011, two years ahead of DEP's requirement.
Penn Township has had issues with high nitrate readings that prompted the DEP to require the township to put a filtration system in place.
Kratzer said the township will bring in a portable filtration system and operate it until the permanent filtration system is completed. He said residents will no longer be exposed to unfiltered public water.
"The issues are not issues created by our fault to treat or any operator error. They are not caused by anyone's error," Kratzer said. "We've been doing this successfully for 12 years."

St. John the Baptist Parish issued the following news release:
The BOIL WATER ORDER for the EDGARD area of St. John the Baptist Parish has been lifted. The order followed a weather incident that occurred Sunday causing a tree to fall onto a power line. This caused a power outage and activation of the back-up diesel generator. After two hours, the diesel generator fuel filters became clogged and were required to undergo maintenance and cleaning prior to being reactivated. As a result, the pressure system for the water was at zero for approximately one hour. Water testing was performed and sent to the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) for approval. A negative result was attained confirming that the water is safe to drink.
"Our staff has worked diligently since Sunday to make sure our Edgard residents' water is safe to drink. We'd like to thank the residents for their patience and cooperation in taking all the necessary precautions", said Parish President Natalie Robottom.

The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality issued the following news release:
The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has advised Mycoland RV & Mobile Home Park in Osage County to inform users of its drinking water to use bottled water or another acceptable source due to the presence of E. coli.
Due to high levels of nitrates in the water provided by this particular system, boiling the water is NOT recommended, making this different from a typical boil advisory. Boiling water with elevated nitrate levels may further increase the nitrate levels.
Until this matter has been resolved, consumers should use bottled water or another acceptable source for consumption, food preparation, washing dishes and brushing teeth.
Federal law requires that consumers be notified when a public water supply exceeds certain maximum contaminant levels and might be harmful to the health of consumers.

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
The state Department of Health is advising customers of the Vader water system in Lewis County to boil their drinking water until further notice. The health advisory is being issued because of a break in one of the city's distribution lines that occurred late last night.
The break caused an outage to about five homes on the system. Service to those homes has been restored. It also caused the entire system to lose pressure, which could allow bacteria and other contaminants to enter the water system. The advisory affects about 600 residents.
The city is working to restore service, disinfect, and flush the system and test water for contaminants. The boil water advisory is likely to last through the holiday weekend until water quality tests show the water is safe to drink.
State health officials advise customers to use boiled or purchased bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth, dishwashing, preparing food, and making ice. Tap water should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before use.
Vader has been dealing with aging system problems that have caused multiple outages and the need to issue health advisories in the past few years. The department is working with Vader and Lewis County on a long-term solution to their water problems.

The following information was released by the state of Rhode Island:
The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) is issuing a precautionary boil water advisory for customers of the United Water, Narragansett Pt. Judith, Narragansett North End, South Kingstown South Shore, and South Kingstown Middlebridge water systems. HEALTH recommends that water being used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, cooking or bathing of infants should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. Bottled water can also be used.
Water pressure in these communities dropped below acceptable limits and therefore, the likelihood for bacteria contamination increases. The water systems are working closely with HEALTH to correct the problem as soon as possible.
All water system customers are urged to limit water usage to allow the system to restore normal water pressure. United Water and the towns of Narragansett and South Kingstown have banned all outdoor water use until further notice. In addition, the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has agreed to close cold-water showers at state beaches.
This boil water advisory is in effect until further notice from HEALTH. Customers of United Water, Narragansett Pt. Judith, and Narragansett North End, South Kingstown South Shore, and South Kingstown Middlebridge water systems are asked to contact neighbors who may not be aware of this advisory. For information, contact: United Water, Stan Knox, 789-0271; Narragansett Pt. Judith and Narragansett North End, Jeffry Ceasrine, 789-1044; South Kingstown South Shore and South Kingstown Middlebridge, Jon Schock, 789-9331, x2250.

July 06--The water main break that was the cause of a water boil advisory has been repaired but some water authority customers are still advised to boil their water.
Patrick M. Caulfield, Schuylkill Municipal Authority executive director said Tuesday that the main was repaired late Monday night and water was restored.
"We had a field crew on site that completed the work late Monday evening," Caulfield said. Caulfield said a water boil advisory is still in effect for those customers affected by water loss Monday.
He said that includes customers in the 400 block through and including the 800 block of Howard Avenue as well as the 100 blocks of South Sixth Street and South Seventh Street.
"We posted everyone that was affected through our automatic dialing system and we will follow up with another call," Caulfield said. "We will initiate another call to lift the boil advisory."
Caulfield said he expects the boil advisory to last about two days.
"Water must be sent for bacterial testing and it takes two days for the results to come back,' he said. "We will make sure the tests come back clear before we lift the boil advisory."

Boil water advisory in 2 RI towns amid record heat

Rhode Island health officials are advising residents of Narragansett and South Kingstown to boil their water before using it after high demand caused water pressure to drop, increasing the chances of contamination.
Customers of several water systems in the beach towns were advised by the state Department of Health Tuesday to boil and cool their water before drinking it, using it to brush their teeth or cook in it.
Spokeswoman Annemarie Beardsworth says the record heat combined with the holiday weekend and tourist season at area beaches to create high-than-expected water demand.
The towns have banned all outdoor water use until further notice, and the health department is asking residents to limit their use of water to allow the system to restore normal water pressure.

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
Customers of the City of Vader water system no longer have to boil their drinking water. A health advisory issued Saturday has ended because lab tests received today show the water meets safe drinking water standards.
The utility issued the advisory after a water main broke, causing an outage to about five homes and loss of pressure throughout the water distribution system. The pressure loss could have allowed contaminated or untreated water to be drawn into the system, so the advisory was issued as a public health precaution. About 600 residents in the Lewis County community were affected.
Utility crews repaired the broken water main, flushed the lines, verified chlorine levels in the system and took numerous water samples to test for bacterial contamination.
City, county, and state officials will hold a public meeting on July 20 to discuss the future of Vader's water system. The meeting will be from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at Vader's Lions Hall.
Vader has been dealing with aging water system problems for the past several years. The state Department of Health is working with the city and Lewis County on a long-term solution.
Customers who have questions about their water may call 360-295-3222.

July 06--A water main break cracked and buckled a street near D.G. Yuengling & Son Inc. brewery in Pottsville on Monday evening.
Schuylkill County Municipal Authority issued a water boil advisory for the west end of the city, which includes Mahantongo Street, Howard Avenue and Schuylkill Avenue, according to an authority spokeswoman.
The break occurred at 6:15 p.m. on South Sixth Street, between Howard and Schuylkill avenues. Authorities, including Pottsville firefighters, responded.
"We have very little water pressure. And it's very muddy," said Craig Nakata, who lives in the area.
The tiny brown river rushed from a crack in the street down to Mahantongo Street. It drew crowds as it cooled down warm pavements that had baked all day in the 90-degree heat.
Harry Walls, 7, of Pottsville, watched as the flow crashed against the cracks in the pavement.
Patrick M. Caulfield, municipal authority executive director, and Lou Romano, marketing manager for D.G. Yuengling & Son Inc., could not be reached for comment Monday night.

PROVIDENCE, R.I., July 6 -- The Rhode Island Department of Health issued the following news release:
The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) is issuing a precautionary boil water advisory for customers of the United Water, Narragansett Pt. Judith, Narragansett North End, South Kingstown South Shore, and South Kingstown Middlebridge water systems. HEALTH recommends that water being used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, cooking or bathing of infants should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. Bottled water can also be used.
Water pressure in these communities dropped below acceptable limits and therefore, the likelihood for bacteria contamination increases. The water systems are working closely with HEALTH to correct the problem as soon as possible.
All water system customers are urged to limit water usage to allow the system to restore normal water pressure. United Water and the towns of Narragansett and South Kingstown have banned all outdoor water use until further notice. In addition, the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has agreed to close cold-water showers at state beaches.
This boil water advisory is in effect until further notice from HEALTH. Customers of United Water, Narragansett Pt. Judith, and Narragansett North End, South Kingstown South Shore, and South Kingstown Middlebridge water systems are asked to contact neighbors who may not be aware of this advisory. For information, contact: United Water, Stan Knox, 789-0271; Narragansett Pt. Judith and Narragansett North End, Jeffry Ceasrine, 789-1044; South Kingstown South Shore and South Kingstown Middlebridge, Jon Schock, 789-9331, x2250.
For general information about drinking water, contact HEALTH's Information Line at 222-5960, Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. For information on guidelines for food establishments during and after a boil water advisory, visit http://www.health.ri.gov/environment/dwq/boiladvisory.php.

July 07--The water main break that was the cause of a water boil advisory Monday night has been repaired but those affected are still advised to boil their water.
Patrick M. Caulfield, Schuylkill Municipal Authority executive director, said Tuesday that the main was repaired late Monday and water restored.
"We had a field crew on site that completed the work late Monday evening," Caulfield said. Caulfield said a water boil advisory is still in effect for those customers affected by water loss Monday.
He said that includes customers in the 400 block through and including the 800 block of Howard Avenue as well as the 100 blocks of South Sixth and South Seventh streets.
"We posted everyone that was affected through our automatic dialing system and we will follow up with another call," Caulfield said. "We will initiate another call to lift the boil advisory."
The break occurred at 6:15 p.m. near D.G. Yuengling & Sons Inc. brewery in Pottsville on South Sixth Street, between Howard and Schuylkill avenues. It caused part of the street to crack and buckle and muddy brown water gushed from the crack.
Residents near the area had little water pressure
Caulfield said he expects the boil advisory to last about two days.
"Water must be sent for bacterial testing and it takes two days for the results to come back," he said. "We will make sure the tests come back clear before we lift the boil advisory."

The following information was released by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources:
A boil water advisory has been issued for residents of Bluffview, located along U.S. 12 in Sauk County about seven miles south of Baraboo, the state Department of Natural Resources reported Thursday afternoon.
All residents on the west side of Highway 12 are advised to boil their water prior to drinking or preparing food. Ice, food and any beverages prepared with unsafe water must be discarded. Persons in Bluffview should boil or use commercially bottled water for drinking, food preparation and making ice. If you boil water, the water should be heated to a rolling boil for at least one minute before use. Ice should be made from boiled or bottled water.
A water sample collected July 1 indicated the presence of coliform bacteria. Further sampling July 6 confirmed their presence. While coliform bacteria, naturally present in the environment, are not generally harmful themselves, they are an indicator that other, potentially-harmful, bacteria may be present.
Coliforms were found in more samples than allowed and this was a warning of potential problems. Whenever the DNR detects coliform bacteria in any sample, the department does follow-up testing to see if other bacteria of greater concern, such as fecal coliform or E. coli, are present. The department did not find any of these bacteria in subsequent testing.
The advisory will be lifted when there are two rounds of safe samples, said Dave Barkhahn, DNR water supply engineer. A notice will be issued when that occurs.

Penn Lifts Boil-Water Advisory

Penn Township removed the boil-water advisory Tuesday, nearly three weeks after the public water supply tested positive for the parasite cryptosporidium.
Notices were hand-delivered to residents.
Cryptosporidium, a bacterium, was detected in the water on June 25. The state Department of Environmental Protection approved a plan for the township to flush out the system.
Dave Kratzer, township manager, said Monday the last two tests conducted by the township for the parasite came back negative.
The township had to wait 18-hours after running the normal bacteria test for E. coli and chloroforms on Monday before the DEP gave the all clear.
The township installed a portable filtering system at a cost of $25,000 per month to filter all township water. The system provides a 0.1 micron filtering system. The size of the cryptosporidium is 3 to 5 microns. Cryptosporidium bacteria are resistant to chlorine but can be filtered out or killed with high temperatures.
"There has not been untreated water entering the system since July 2," Kratzer said Monday.
The portable filtering system will remain in place until the permanent water filtration system is built and online, which is expected to next year. The project is expected to cost about $3 million.
After the bacteria alert, the township shut down its well and tapped into Manheim Borough's water supply to try to provide filtered water for the residents. Manheim Borough could not provide the amount of water needed because of poor infrastructure, Dave Sarley, Penn supervisor chairman, said Monday.
The borough has an aging system of pipes, and maps of the system are incomplete. Sarley said the borough has the water capacity, but not the facilities to support it.
The borough "had paved over a valve that was closed. They did not even know they had it. (Township Supervisor Daryl) Lefever found it and dug it up," said Sarley. "Five minutes after we hooked into borough water, people were out of water. There may be a lot of water there, but it could not get here."
The township had to put the well back online to supplement the water from the borough, Sarley said, and the township disconnected from the borough water system Monday.
He said the township has no plans to permanently connect to the borough water supply in the future.
The township provided residents with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when the boil-water advisory was lifted. The guidelines advise residents to flush pipes and faucets.
Guidelines include running cold-water faucets continuously for five minutes, making and discarding three batches of ice from automatic ice makers, running water softeners through a regeneration cycle, draining and refilling water heaters set below 113 degrees Fahrenheit and changing filters on all point-of-entry and point-of-use water filters.

NMED Lifts 'Boil Water Advisory' for Kamp Kiwanis in McKinley County

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's (NMED) Drinking Water Bureau advised the Kamp Kiwanis to lift a "boil water advisory" for its water system.
NMED issued the advisory after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level for E. coli was discovered in drinking water from the water system. NMED required the Kamp Kiwanis non-community water system in McKinley County to notify its consumers of the finding.
Actions to disinfect the water system and identify possible sources of contamination were promptly taken. These actions included shock chlorination. Consumers were advised to boil all water prior to ingestion.
Water samples collected on July 10 and July 12, 2010 have shown no E. coli present in the water system. These clean results have allowed NMED's Drinking Water Bureau to advise Kamp Kiwanis to lift the "boil water advisory" for its water system.
The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms, which are sometimes found in sewage or animal wastes. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, even death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or the DWB Water System Specialist Diane Barnes at 505-566-9744.

The residents were upset after nearly three weeks of interrupted service because officials declared a boil-water advisory after cryptosporidium, a parasite, was found in public water.
Supervisors responded with concern about threats heard by township employees who were trying to fix the problem.
Dave Sarley, supervisor chairman, said the township was inundated with calls. Drivers yelled at workers trying to connect the township to the Manheim Borough waterlines, he said.
"A woman rolled her (car) window down and said, 'I hope you all die in that ditch.' I find this to be absolutely reprehensible," Sarley said. "These guys busted their butts so you'd have drinking water. You couldn't have gotten a more perfect storm with what we went through."
Sarley said the township placed workers under police protection while shifts ran 24-hours a day.
"We are not the community you have painted us. We are a caring community. All we wanted was to know," said Pat Drennen, board member of Brookshire Homeowners Association. "We tried to be on top of it to know what to do."
Some residents blamed the situation on the local farms.
Sarley said that cryptosporidium is everywhere. It is in human and animal feces, in the grass, in raccoons, in dogs and in mice.
The source of Penn Township water is the same aquifer that supplies water to Lititz and Manheim borough, Sarley said.
He also suggested that residents with private wells might want to have them tested.
The test for cryptosporidium is expensive and only done by specialized labs, Sarley said.
"Cryptosporidium has been around forever," he said. "Where we failed, we didn't get information to you on a daily basis. I think that is a valid criticism."
The township in responding to the crisis by collecting the phone numbers of all residents to make it faster and easier to get information out. In addition, the township will make daily updates when faced with a public crisis.
The township is in the process of obtaining permits to build a water filtration plant that will address cryptosporidium and nitrates. The plant will cost around $3 million.
"I promise in the future, if we get a major crisis, we will try to do better," Sarley said.

BOIL WATER ADVISORY ISSUED FOR THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS
States News Service

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Minneapolis, which is located in Ottawa County.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory due to a break in a water main, which resulted in a loss of pressure in the distribution system. The water main is in the process of being repaired and whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) residuals may drop to levels that are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
Residents in the City of Minneapolis served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. The city and/or KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded.

State lifts boil water advisory in Bluffview

.The state has lifted a "boil water" advisory for residents in Bluffview after sampling done this week showed the water supply is safe.
Bluffview is a small residential area on U.S. 12 south of Baraboo, across from the old Badger Army Ammunition plant.
The advisory was issued on July 8 by the Department of Natural Resources after coliform bacteria was found in the water.
The advisory was rescinded on Thursday after a second round of safe water samples were reported to the DNR by the State Laboratory of Hygiene in Madison.
"Two rounds of three samples were collected this week from the distribution system and all samples were reported to be safe," DNR water supply engineer Dave Barkhahn of Horicon said in a news release.
"It appears that chlorination was effective in eliminating the coliform bacteria from the water system," Barkhahn said. "Three more samples will be collected next week."
During the advisory, all residents in Bluffview were advised to boil their water prior to drinking or preparing food, or to use commercially bottled water.
A water sample collected July 1 indicated the presence of coliform bacteria. Further sampling July 6 confirmed the presence. While coliform bacteria, which are naturally present in the environment, are not generally harmful themselves, they are an indicator that other, potentially harmful bacteria may be present.

Environment Department Issues 'Boil Water Advisory' for Socorro Water System Customers are urged to Boil Water Prior to Drinking

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau has issued a "boil water advisory for the Socorro Water System.
NMED issued the advisory today after bacteriological contamination was discovered in one of the drinking water sources for the Socorro Water System. NMED requires the Socorro Water System to notify water consumers of the finding. This advisory only applies to the drinking water at the Socorro Water System, and does not extend to any of the other surrounding water systems.
Consumers of water at the Socorro Water System are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing. The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
The NMED Drinking Water Bureau will provide technical assistance to the water system and will test the water until no further threat of contamination remains.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 660-3834.

New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology issued the following news release:
After extensive monitoring of the City of Socorro water supply, the state Environmental Department lifted the boil water order at noon Monday.
The state Environmental Department on Saturday, July 17, instructed the City of Socorro to issue a "boil water order" after E. coli was found at the Sedillo Spring well.
E. Coli is a bacterium that can cause food poisoning in humans. E. Coli was found during regular testing at the water source Sedillo Spring, which is one of five water sources used by the City of Socorro.
For the KRQE news report, click here (http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/health/city-heeds-e-coli-contamination-warning).
For the local report in the Defensor Chieftain, click here (http://www.dchieftain.com/dc/index.php/news/1751-boil-water-advisory.html).
Further testing showed no E. coli in the domestic water distribution system; however, the City has issued a boil water order for the entire town until the source tests clean.
Consumers of water at the Socorro Water System are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
Jim McLain, assistant director of Facilities Management at Tech, said the west and north sides of campus draw water from sources other than Sedillo Spring. The south side of the main campus draws water from Sedillo Spring.
The NMED Drinking Water Bureau will provide technical assistance to the water system and will test the water until no further threat of contamination remains.

Gov. Steve Beshear, D-Ky., issued the following news release:
Governor Steve Beshear visited areas of Pike County today following weekend storms that caused severe flooding and mudslides. The storms are blamed for two deaths in Pike County.
"I have seen startling and significant damage in Pike County today," said Gov. Beshear. "My administration, from Emergency Management to the Transportation Cabinet and beyond, is working quickly to get these struggling Kentucky families the help they need."
Gov. Beshear's trip included stops at Raccoon Creek and a meeting with local officials at the Pike County Courthouse. Gov. Beshear declared a State of Emergency on Sunday for Pike and Shelby counties and requested Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct preliminary damage assessments. Seven FEMA assessment teams will begin work tomorrow.
"My heart goes out to the hundreds of families impacted by this torrential flooding. I want to assure the people of Pike County that help is on the way and we will utilize every resource to help those paralyzed by this natural disaster," said Congressman Hal Rogers. "I applaud the Governor for declaring a state of emergency and as necessary, I will be working with officials here in Washington to make sure that things are moving as quickly as possible to bring temporary relief while we begin the rebuilding process. While more challenges lie ahead, I know the resilient people of Pike County and together we will overcome this tragedy and become a stronger community."
Up to eight inches of rain fell in a short period of time, prompting emergency evacuations and rescues. Pike Co. Emergency Management officials estimate approximately 200 homes were damaged or destroyed by the weekend's flooding and mudslides.
"It looks more like a tornado has been through here than a flood in some places," said Pike County Judge Executive Wayne T. Rutherford. "This is the most devastating flood I have ever seen. But we are resilient in these mountains and we will pull through it."
Approximately 400 residents remain without power in Pike County, down from more than 7,000 Sunday. Approximately 13,500 residents are without water, and another 13,000 are under a boil water advisory. Water distribution points will operate until restoration is complete. One shelter remains open at Pike Central High School, where 25 people stayed Sunday night. The Kentucky Community Crises Response Board (KCCRB) sent a counseling team to the area on Sunday and is expected to have expanded teams in the county beginning today.
Safety Tips
* Kentuckians are encouraged to monitor river and streams crests for their areas and heed warnings or evacuation orders from local officials. Do not drive through or wade through any water, no matter if just a few inches. STOP, TURN AROUND - DON'T DROWN!
* Do not attempt to enter flooded structures unless a certified electrician has shut the power off.
* Be aware of toxic or hazardous wastes associated with flood waters. For additional information on health safety tips and flood water clean-up, please visit the Department for Public Health's website at www.chfs.ky.gov/dph/.

Gov. Steve Beshear, D-Ky., issued the following news release:
Through a coordinated joint effort, Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) teams consisting of personnel from local, state and federal government have begun gathering damage estimates from local government and private citizens in Pike County.
"The aftermath of the flooding in Pike County is really unlike anything I've seen before," said Gov. Beshear, who visited the area yesterday to meet with local officials. "Swiftly moving water is extremely dangerous and its ability to cause destruction should never be underestimated."
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel arrived in Pike County yesterday. After being briefed by local and Kentucky Division of Emergency Management (KYEM) officials, teams were assembled and county assessments were assigned. These teams will begin PDAs throughout the county today. These damage assessments will be used to support Gov. Beshear's request for federal assistance.
"We are hoping to expedite the assistance process by having the FEMA teams conduct these damage assessments with our local teams," said John Heltzel, director for KYEM. "We want to bring whatever assistance is needed, and eligible, to all of Pike County and its residents as soon as possible."
Officials encourage those who have suffered property damage to photograph the damage, save any repair receipts and report your damage to the local emergency management director.
The Kentucky National Guard currently has 24 Soldiers on duty providing support to Pike County. For the past several days, members of the 577th Sapper Company, 201st Engineer Battalion have conducted security patrols in humvees in support of local law enforcement, and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crews have assisted in damage assessment. Additional troops from the 201st are being brought on to provide communications and logistical support in the distribution of bottled water.
If you do not have the family and/or financial resources to clean out your property, you can call 606-432-0210 to request volunteer assistance. "Folks need to be aware volunteer groups are available to help clean up they cannot dismantle or remove destroyed homes," said Jim Garrett, Voluntary Agency Liaison for Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD).
Safety Messages:
* Do not drive through or wade through any water, no matter if it's just a few inches. STOP - TURN AROUND - DON'T DROWN!
* The Kentucky Division of Water (DOW) reports that boil water advisories are in effect for much of the county due to broken lines and other factors. Water distribution points have been established to assist those without water. Check with your local government for current water distribution locations.
* DOW also warns against contact with floodwaters due to contamination from sewage, agricultural products and other harmful substances.
* The Kentucky Department of Public Health (DPH) encourages flooded residents to be aware of toxic or hazardous wastes associated with flood waters. For additional information on health safety tips and flood water clean-up, please visit the DPH's website at www.chfs.ky.gov/dph/ or contact the local health department.

The following information was released by the office of the governor of Kentucky:
Through a coordinated joint effort, Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) teams consisting of personnel from local, state and federal government have begun gathering damage estimates from local government and private citizens in Pike County.
The aftermath of the flooding in Pike County is really unlike anything I've seen before, said Gov. Beshear, who visited the area yesterday to meet with local officials. Swiftly moving water is extremely dangerous and its ability to cause destruction should never be underestimated.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel arrived in Pike County yesterday. After being briefed by local and Kentucky Division of Emergency Management (KYEM) officials, teams were assembled and county assessments were assigned. These teams will begin PDAs throughout the county today. These damage assessments will be used to support Gov. Beshear's request for federal assistance.
We are hoping to expedite the assistance process by having the FEMA teams conduct these damage assessments with our local teams, said John Heltzel, director for KYEM. We want to bring whatever assistance is needed, and eligible, to all of Pike County and its residents as soon as possible.
Officials encourage those who have suffered property damage to photograph the damage, save any repair receipts and report your damage to the local emergency management director.
The Kentucky National Guard currently has 24 Soldiers on duty providing support to Pike County. For the past several days, members of the 577th Sapper Company, 201st Engineer Battalion have conducted security patrols in humvees in support of local law enforcement, and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crews have assisted in damage assessment. Additional troops from the 201st are being brought on to provide communications and logistical support in the distribution of bottled water.
If you do not have the family and/or financial resources to clean out your property, you can call 606-432-0210 to request volunteer assistance. Folks need to be aware volunteer groups are available to help clean up they cannot dismantle or remove destroyed homes, said Jim Garrett, Voluntary Agency Liaison for Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD).
Safety Messages:
Do not drive through or wade through any water, no matter if it's just a few inches. STOP TURN AROUND DON'T DROWN!
The Kentucky Division of Water (DOW) reports that boil water advisories are in effect for much of the county due to broken lines and other factors. Water distribution points have been established to assist those without water. Check with your local government for current water distribution locations.
DOW also warns against contact with floodwaters due to contamination from sewage, agricultural products and other harmful substances.
The Kentucky Department of Public Health (DPH) encourages flooded residents to be aware of toxic or hazardous wastes associated with flood waters. For additional information on health safety tips and flood water clean-up, please visit the DPH's website at www.chfs.ky.gov/dph/ or contact the local health department.
Do not attempt to enter flooded structures unless a certified electrician has shut the power off.
Avoid unnecessary sight seeing, keeping the roadways clear and allowing emergency officials access to the impacted areas.

V.I. now sending out emergency alerts online and by phone
The Virgin Islands Daily News, St. Thomas
July 20, 2010 Tuesday

July 20--ST. THOMAS -- If a tsunami, hurricane or any other natural disaster is headed toward the territory, now anyone can be alerted to the situation within seconds after those who monitor such things find out themselves.
In a news conference Monday, the V.I. Territorial Emergency Management Agency announced the launch of VI-Alert, a system that sends disaster alerts directly to the public.
By signing up at VITEMA's website, www.vitema.gov, Virgin Islanders can choose how they want to be notified of the threat -- via a text message, a phone call, a fax, an e-mail, page, RSS feed or even Twitter.
"This system was chosen realizing that today's citizens are increasingly relying on modern communications technologies as their information sources -- cell phones, PDAs, Internet -- whereas most traditional emergency alert systems provide alerts by television and broadcast radio systems," Gov. Jongh deJongh Jr. said at the news conference.
But traditional alert systems will not be left out, and neither will people who don't have Internet access. VI-Alert allows users to set up notifications for family members and friends who are not online, and television, radio and other media outlets can sign up for Common Alerting Protocol notifications -- a standardized warning system used to disseminate the same warnings, the same way, over local, regional and national outlets.
Additionally, VITEMA Director Mark Walters announced Monday that his agency has selected a contractor to install a siren system in the territory to warn residents of weather threats. Walters declined to name the contractor selected or the cost of the project, until negotiations are complete, but he said that alarms will be funded with federal Homeland Security grants.
Walter said he hopes to have the sirens -- which will be tied to VI-Alert -- in place by the end of hurricane season.
VITEMA started working on VI-Alert in March, when a high-level team of Virgin Islands emergency responders sat down and, as an exercise, tried to figure out how they would notify the public if there was a disaster at one of the V.I. Water and Power Authority's power plants.
"We realized that we had a significant shortfall in our ability to reach out to the public in a quick and timely manner," Walters said.
So, Walters turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is, technically, still his employer. Walters is on loan from FEMA's New York offices, where he is the Region II director of Mission Support, and FEMA pays his salary while he is serving as VITEMA director.
VI-Alert taps into the New York state's $13 million emergency notification system. VITEMA has paid $40,000 in start-up costs to link into New York's system, and will pay $20,000 per year in maintenance costs after the first year.
For those who sign up to receive them, earthquake alerts will be sent directly from the U.S. Geological Survey; tsunami alerts will come straight from the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center; and severe weather notices will be issued directly from the National Weather Service.
Other warnings will be written by VITEMA, then sent out to the public.
Currently, VI-Alert is equipped to offer severe weather alerts; earthquake and tsunami alerts; beach closings; and public health alerts, such as boil-water advisories.
Walters said that he is in discussion with other government agencies to add other bulletins, including those for a missing child notifications, an escaped prisoner or a gunman at large.
VITEMA also is working with the territory's public and private schools, as well as the University of the Virgin Islands, to sign up students for school-specific alerts.
Kevin Ross, assistant IT director of the New York State Emergency Management Office, who developed New York's alert system, said he is in talks with cruise ship companies to obtain copies of their ships manifest, so cruise passengers can be signed up for VI-Alert while they are in port. The passengers' contact information would be automatically deleted from the system once they leave the Virgin Islands, Ross said.
In October, New York will roll out a new version of the system, which will include applications for iPhones, Blackberries, Droids, Windows Mobile Devices and personal computers. A VI-Alert version of the applications will come out simultaneously, Ross said.
The updated version also will have Spanish language capabilities, and Walters said a Spanish-speaking VITEMA employee will translate the warnings.

Penn Will Cut Water Bills

Penn Township is rebating water costs to residents placed under a boil water advisory for nearly three weeks that ended July 13.
About 575 water customers will receive a 25 percent discount on their water bills.
"We will prorate your water bills for the 22 days. We will adjust the bills so your water bills will be discounted," Dave Sarley, supervisor chairman, said July 12.
The township issued a boil water advisory when a parasite, cryptosporidium, was found in the water supply. At the time, the township water was not filtered. It was treated with chlorine, which cryptosporidium is resistant to.
Cryptosporidium causes intestinal symptoms, especially in people who have a suppressed immune system.
Township Manager Dave Kratzer said July 12 that the township had received no reports of illness.
The township brought in a portable system July 2 at a cost of $25,000 a month. The rented unit will filter the water until a permanent system is built sometime in 2011. Kratzer said the township will not be passing on these costs to the residents.
Public water users were without water for a period of 45 minutes during the boil water advisory. In an e-mail dated July 16, Kratzer said the outage occurred July 11 and was caused by an electrical issue with a motor.
The interconnection that the township tried with the Manheim Borough Water Authority did not provide adequate pressure to supply water to higher elevations of the water system. As a result, Kratzer said, the water storage tank went offline.
The future filtration plant will cost the township about $3 million. It will filter out bacteria and also address the nitrate issues the township has had with the public water.
The township had two high nitrate readings in February, which triggered the need for a feasibility study required by the state Department of Environmental Protection.

GOV. BESHEAR DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY FOLLOWING STORMS AND FLOODING

The following information was released by the office of the governor of Kentucky:
Governor Steve Beshear today declared a State of Emergency in Kentucky following severe storms that struck Pike and Shelby counties early Sunday morning and several northeastern Kentuckian counties late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. The storms have caused flash flooding, evacuations and water rescues in the northeastern Kentucky counties of Carter, Elliott, Lewis, Mason and Rowan counties. Those counties have each declared states of emergency; the cities of Olive Hill and Maysville have also declared local states of emergency.
Gov. Beshear also signed an executive order today to trigger the price gouging statutes that protect consumers from unscrupulous businesses that attempt to artificially inflate prices as a result of the emergency.
The executive order will allow for investigation into any complaints of price gouging that may occur relative to gas, heating, building supplies, hotels and other goods and services in the aftermath of the weekend's storms.
Weather reports indicate as much as six inches of rain has fallen on parts of northeast Kentucky. The Little Sandy River is rising and expected to crest above flood stage in Grayson. American Electric Power reports approximately 566 customers in Letcher, Carter and Lewis counties are currently without power. Approximately 400 Lewis County homes are currently without water.
In Carter County, a shelter operated by the Salvation Army has opened at Grahn Community Center. Early estimates indicate that 50 to 60 homes in Carter County were affected by the floods, approximately 20 of which are destroyed. Eight roads are currently underwater in Fleming County. KY-57 is closed at the Fleming-Lewis county line and multiple roads are closed in the Laurel Camp Dix area in Lewis County. Forty homes in Rowan County have been flooded, two of which have been destroyed. At least 100 cars were flooded, and 20 county bridges and 20 private bridges with approaches have been washed out.
Officials expect the amount of damages to increase as water recedes in the impacted counties, as emergency workers and local officials will be able to reach areas previously under water and hope to have a better assessment on the extent of damage.
These latest floods came just days after heavy thunderstorms hit Pike and Shelby counties. Two fatalities are attributed to the Pike County storms. Gov. Steve Beshear declared states of emergency for both counties over the weekend. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assessment teams have been working to evaluate damages in Pike County for two days, which will expedite the process for applying for any applicable federal assistance.
Pike County updates
Local, state and federal damage assessment teams continue assessing the property damage in Pike County.
In Pike County, 2,400 residents remain without water and much of the county remains on boil water advisories. Volunteers are taking drinking water to impacted areas, and water distribution points have been established throughout the county. Three shelters are open in the area.
Safety Tips
Kentuckians are encouraged to monitor weather (www.weather.com) for their areas and heed warnings or evacuation orders from local officials. Do not drive through or wade through any water, no matter if just a few inches. STOP, TURN AROUND DON'T DROWN!
Do not attempt to enter flooded structures unless a certified electrician has shut off the power.

Environment Department Issues 'Boil Water Advisory' for El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau has issued a "boil water advisory" for the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System.
NMED issued the advisory on July 23, 2010 after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level for E. coli was discovered in drinking water at the water system. NMED requires the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association to notify water consumers of the finding. The El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System is located approximately 20 miles south of Santa Fe. This advisory only applies to customers served by the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association, and does not extend to any of the other surrounding water systems or communities.
Consumers of water at the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing. The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
Actions have been initiated to disinfect the water system and identify possible sources of contamination, establish acceptable disinfection, and flush out the water system. The NMED Drinking Water Bureau will provide technical assistance to the water system and will test the water until no further threat of contamination remains.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 660-3834.

July 26--IRONTON -- Residents on one block in Ironton should continue until tomorrow to boil their water before drinking it.
A cautionary boil-water advisory was issued for residents of Eighth Street from Washington to Adams Street because of a water main break that occurred around 4 a.m. Sunday, said Steve Collins, water plant operator for the City of Ironton.
"Anytime you shut the water off you have to put out an advisory," Collins said.
The water will be tested and the advisory should be lifted Tuesday, he said.

Gov. Steve Beshear, D-Ky., issued the following news release:
Gov. Steve Beshear today said that local emergency management officials continue conducting damage assessments from last week's devastating storms, which caused severe flooding in several northeastern Kentucky counties.
Gov. Beshear was notified late Friday afternoon that President Barack Obama approved his request for a major disaster declaration for Pike County for assistance from the severe storms and flooding that hit Saturday, July 17, causing two fatalities and severe damage across the county. This presidential declaration came just two days after the Governor made his request to the president for federal assistance.
"I am extremely pleased that we were able to validate the damage, submit the request and be awarded federal assistance so quickly," said Gov. Beshear. "I am also pleased that as soon as other counties hit the eligibility thresholds we will be able to add them to the existing presidential major disaster declaration. Not having to submit separate requests for each impacted county will greatly expedite the delivery of necessary federal assistance."
Shelby County was also hard hit by storms on July 17, and damage assessments are underway. Carter, Elliot, Lawrence, Lewis, Mason and Rowan counties declared state of emergencies due to severe flooding on July 20 and 21 and damage assessments are continuing in those counties. If those counties reach the required damage threshold, they will be added to the President's major disaster declaration. Approximately 2,225 customers remain on boiled water advisories in these northeastern Kentucky counties.
Details of the Pike County Disaster Declaration, KY-1925
July 23 - President Obama granted federal disaster assistance for both Individual Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA) for Pike County:
* The President's action makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Pike County.
* Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
* Federal funding also is available to the state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding and mudslides in Pike County.
* Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
* Pike County residents and business owners who sustained losses can begin applying for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (local time). Residents MUST register with FEMA to be eligible for assistance.
* Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Mobile Disaster Recovery Centers opened earlier today in Pike County at two locations: in the lower parking lot of Pikeville/Pike County Community Funeral Home located on Zebulon Highway and the second location is at the mouth of Harlesses' Creek on US Hwy 460 at Community Bank.
* Approximately 25,000 Pike County customers remain on boiled water advisories and 75 residents on Harlesses' Creek are without water.

Expert Joins Penn Water Authority

Penn Township approved the appointment of resident Charles Smith to the Northwestern Lancaster County Authority at the July 12 supervisors meeting.
Smith, an expert on cryptosporidium, offered his services when the parasite was found in the public water system in June. "This is one of the more positive things that came out of the water crisis," Dave Sarley, supervisor chairman, said. "He's an expert on all these little bugs."
Smith is a certified water technologist. He said only 400 people hold this certification nationally, and it represents the highest credential in the industrial and commercial water treatment field. Smith was one of the first 60 people to receive the certification. Exam requirements exam include five years of experience investigating water treatment problems and implementing corrective action.
"He has impeccable credentials," Sarley said. "With his knowledge of cryptosporidium, I said I got to have this guy. We're happy to have you."
When the parasite was found in the water, the township issued a boil water advisory. Smith told supervisors and about 20 residents at the meeting the parasite is a macro organism that can be filtered out of the water system. It is a hardy parasite that is encapsulated, protecting it from chemicals like chlorine.
"Cryptosporidium has to complete its life cycle. It needs a warm host to complete its cycle," Smith said. Without a host, the cryptosporidium cannot reproduce, and it is not harmful, he said.
Mike Wolgemuth of Severn Trent, the firm that oversees the water treatment, said eight cryptosporidium were found in the water. Since July 2, the township water has used a temporary water filtration system that will be operational until a permanent filtering plant is built next year.

Environment Department Lifts 'Boil Water Advisory' for Tajique MDWCA in Torrance County

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau is lifting a "boil water advisory" for the Tajique Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association on the east side of the Manzano Mountains in Torrance County.
NMED issued the advisory on April 21 due to multiple failures by the Tajique MDWCA to test for bacteria in the drinking water as required by the New Mexico Drinking Water Regulations. The association, which is a small community water system, serves approximately 180 people. NMED required the Tajique MDWCA to notify its customers and members that the water system was not meeting the water sampling and reporting requirements. While there was no indication of contamination of the drinking water, without bacteria water sample results NMED could not be certain of the safety of the water provided by the Tajique MDWCA.
Subsequent water quality samples have shown no bacteriological contamination of the water system. These clean results have allowed NMED's Drinking Water Bureau to lift the "boil water advisory" for the Tajique MDWCA.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 660-3834.

No boil advisory following break in city water line

Aug. 05--A contractor working on a construction project near Tunnel Road outside Pottsville broke a water line Wednesday morning causing discoloration.
Patrick M. Caulfield, director of the Schuylkill Municipal Authority, said a water boil advisory was not put in effect. He said he expected the issue to clear up on its own.
Caulfield said the break occurred about 9 a.m.
"They contacted us immediately and within minutes we had someone on site able to isolate the break up and down stream and close valves," Caulfield said. "We were still able to keep pressure in all the pipes and water in all the pipes."
The discoloration, Caulfield said, was due to the fact that scaling built up inside the pipe is scuffed away due to the velocity of water surging through the pipe after the break.
"However, there's no contamination, therefore, we are not required to issue a boil water advisory," Caulfield said.
Caulfield said the area where the line was broken is a place where there is redundant line, making it easier to quickly target the problem and make sure customers were not greatly affected.
Roma Pizza, 116 W. Market St., was using 2-liter Coke products instead of fountain soda while the water ran with a brown tint. Hong Kong Buffet, 118 E. Norwegian St., closed its doors Wednesday until the water cleared.
Wendy's on Route 61 North, near the Fairlane Village mall, had a sign posted on the drive-through menu indicating they were closed due to a water problem.
Nearby, McDonald's had suspended serving fountain drinks while the water problem was being addressed.

Bob Elbert, photographer for Iowa State University, documented the   effect of historic flooding on the schools campus in Ames.

The Skunk River crested Wednesday at 26.7 feet at U.S. Highway 30, one foot higher than the previous record in 1993. Squaw Creek crested Wednesday at 18.1 feet, just shy of the 18.5 record in 1993. In addition to the rising waters, the city was forced to shut down its water system because of possible contamination following a large main break. A boil-water advisory is still in effect Thursday morning.

A few of Elberts photos are after the jump. More are available from the Iowa State News Service. There are also photo galleries at   The Ames Tribune and   The Des Moines Register.

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau is lifting a "boil water advisory" for the Tecolote Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association (MDWCA)Water System.
NMED issued the advisory on August 2, 2010 after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level for E. coli was discovered in the water system. NMED required the Tecolote Water System to notify all water consumers of the finding.
Corrective actions were taken by the water system, including disinfecting the water system by increasing the level of chlorination and identifying possible sources of contamination. Consumers were advised to boil all water prior to ingestion.
Water samples collected since the corrective actions were taken have shown no E. coli present in the water system. These clean results have allowed NMED's Drinking Water Bureau to advise the Tecolote MDWCA Water System to lift the "boil water advisory" for the water system.

Flood results in Ames water ˜emergency, mayor says

Flood waters may be receding, but Ames is facing another crisis that could last well into next week: a lack of clean drinking water.

Mayor Ann Campbell told The Ames TribuneThursday that residents should, œtreat this as an emergency every time you use an ounce of water. The city had hoped to restore water by early next week, but now says the continued water use by residents and businesses is hampering the effort and could result in further delays.

From   The Tribune:

City officials authorized residents to begin using water for brief showers, flushing toilets and boiling for drinking water early Thursday, but saw water tower supplies draining by mid-afternoon.

œWhat we need are some temporary lifestyle changes, Water Pollution and Supply Director John Dunn. œWe are not gaining as we had hoped in those tanks.

Ames had to shut down its water distribution system Wednesday afternoon after a main break caused by historic flooding of the Skunk River and Squaw Creek. Two more water main breaks were later identified bringing the total to eight water main breaks that have drained Ames water towers to dangerously low levels. A boil water advisory has been in effect since the initial break Wednesday.

The city was going to begin flushing the system Thursday, but water levels were still too low.

U.S. Rep. Tom Latham, a Republican who represents the portion of Iowa that includes Ames, called the situation with water supplies œdesperate and called on companies and individuals to   donate bottled water. The Republican Party of Iowa is   collecting water and hand sanitizerat its campaign offices in Urbandale and Ames from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday.

Gov.   Chet Culver said Thursday that   six trucks of water have already been secured for Ames and more than 20 are ready to send.

Akron Issues Boil Water Advisory

Residents in Akron Borough are urged to boil water after a well tested positive for E. coli Thursday.
Bacteria was found in one of the borough's eight public wells. The well has been taken off-line and the plant is increasing chlorination and flushing out the system.
The area's 4,000 residents have been put on a boil-water advisory until further notice. The problem is anticipated to be resolved by Friday, Mayor John McBeth said.
E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes, the advisory stated.
Microbes in these wastes can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly and people with severely compromised immune systems.
"Drink boiled or bottled," reminded McBeth.
Boiled water should also be used for making ice, brushing teeth, washing dishes and food preparation.
In July, water in Penn Township tested positive for the parasite cryptosporidium. Residents were put on a 3-week boil-water advisory.
Since July 2, the township has been using a temporary water filtration system. A permanent water filtration system will be built next year, at an estimated cost of $3 million.

Aug. 14, 2010 (Center for Independent Media delivered by Newstex) --

The City of Ames will lift restrictions on water use in place since   floodwaters caused a water main to break on Wednesday. However, residents are warned that the water is still not safe to drink unless it has been boiled.

œWe have made tremendous progress, said John Dunn, director of the citys Water and Pollution Control Department. œWe are progressing better than I dared to hope, but we ask that the public please continue their conservation efforts and dont start using mass amounts of water prior to 2 p.m., as we need to allow the water towers to fill up again.

Ames residents will be able to resume their normal water usage, including laundry, toilet flushing, showers/bathing and outdoor debris clean-up. But until further notice, water coming from the tap should still not be used for purposes such as drinking, brushing teeth, washing dishes, preparing food and making ice unless boiled or treated first. Both commercial and residential dishwashers are also not considered effective means of sanitizing the water.

Safe drinking water will continue to be distributed at all four locations in Ames until the boil advisory is lifted. These sites include Sams Club on Airport Road, McFarland Clinic West (next to West HyVee), ISU Towers parking lot and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) on Grand Avenue. Residents may pick up two gallons of water per person each day.

The city of Ames issued the following news release:
As flushing efforts conclude, the City of Ames' Water Department has announced that the water volume restrictions will be lifted as of 2 p.m. today, including restrictions on exterior water use. Ames citizens will be able to resume their normal water usage, including laundry, toilet flushing, showers/bathing and outdoor debris clean-up. The boil advisory will remain in effect for Ames citizens until further notice.
"We have made tremendous progress," said John Dunn, director of the City's Water and Pollution Control Department. "We are progressing better than I dared to hope, but we ask that the public please continue their conservation efforts and don't start using mass amounts of water prior to 2 p.m., as we need to allow the water towers to fill up again."
Dunn said that crews did respond to a four-inch water main break last night along Murray Drive but repairs were completed by 11 p.m.
Ames citizens are reminded that while the volume restrictions will be lifted, the water is still not safe for human consumption. Water coming from the tap should still not be used for purposes such as drinking, brushing teeth, washing dishes, preparing food, and making ice, unless boiled or treated first. Both commercial and residential dishwashers are also not considered effective means of sanitizing the water.
So far, 88 water samples have been collected by the Water and Pollution Control Department, with 90 more water samples scheduled to be collected today.
Safe drinking water will continue to be distributed at all four locations in Ames until the boil advisory is lifted. These sites include Sam's Club on Airport Road, McFarland Clinic West (next to West HyVee), ISU Towers parking lot, and Wal-Mart on Grand Avenue. Residents may pick up two gallons of water per person each day.
As of 6:00 Saturday morning, water readings for Squaw Creek and the Skunk River were:
* Squaw Creek at Lincoln Way: 4.6 feet
* Skunk River at Riverside Drive: 8.73 feet
* Skunk River at U.S. 30: 18.52 feet
"Health and safety have been, and will continue to be, our main focus," said Mayor Ann Campbell. "The community's response and cooperation is greatly appreciated."
All roads in Ames are now open but drivers are asked to use caution, as there may be debris in some locations.
A 4 p.m. press conference is scheduled for Sunday, August 15, in the council chambers, for further flood updates.

The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality issued the following news release:
The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has advised Shady Valley Mobile Home Park, located in Pottawatomie County, to inform consumers of the drinking water that it is unsafe for human consumption due to the presence of E. coli.
The boil advisory was issued after water samples indicated the presence of E. coli. To ensure the water is safe for human consumption, water served from the Shady Valley Mobile Home Park system should be vigorously boiled for at least one minute before drinking, use in food preparation, washing dishes or brushing teeth.
The advisory to boil water will remain in effect until the water system ensures that chlorination can be adequately maintained and that, if necessary, any required corrections to structural systems or operational practices have been made. DEQ will require that proper testing of water samples indicates the water to be free from E. coli before suspending this advisory.
Federal law requires that consumers be notified when a public water supply exceeds certain maximum contaminant levels and might be harmful to the health of consumers.

ST. THOMAS, Ont. - A boil water advisory has been issued for residents in parts of southern Ontario.
Officials with Elgin St. Thomas Public Health put out the advisory after a routine water test came back positive for E.coli bacteria.
The advisory was issued for St. Thomas along with portions of Southwold and Central Elgin.
Officials say there have been no reports of illness.
Acting medical officer of health, Dr. Frank Warsh, says they're not sure what the source of the E.coli is or whether it's a sampling error.
The health unit is advising residents to bring their water to a rolling boil for at least one minute prior to using it for drinking, brushing teeth, washing raw foods and making ice. (AM980)

(Algae-Toxic-Water)
Public health officials are warning Brockton residents not to use water from two lakes due to potentially harmful toxins from algae.
They say potentially toxic blue-green algae is growing in Marl Lake and Lake Rosalind, north of the town of Hanover.
The municipality includes Walkerton, where tainted water killed seven people in 2000. (The Canadian Press)
(Boil-Water-Advisory)
A positive E.Coli test that prompted a boil water advisory in St. Thomas has turned out to be a false alarm.
The advisory was issued Thursday following lab tests that showed a high level of the bacteria in local water.
But the town's mayor now says those tests were wrong.
The advisory -- which affected about 40-thousand people -- has been lifted. (CKOT)
(Boy-Killed-By-Bus)
Toronto police are seeking witnesses after a 17-year-old boy was struck and killed by a public transit bus.
Police say the boy was hit while crossing the street Friday night.
They say the bus had the green light at the time of the incident. (680 News)

(BC-Pickton-Report-Bias)
A Vancouver police report on the Robert Pickton investigation says families that tried to file missing persons reports faced ''alleged'' prejudice.
It says some staff members were biased against families of the missing sex workers, but the behaviour of a civilian clerk in the Missing Persons Unit was detrimental to the department.
The report by Deputy Chief Constable Doug LePard says the bias ''poisoned'' the V-P-D's relationship with the families.
LePard says officers are now assigned to deal specifically with sex workers in the Downtown Eastside and forge ties with them. (The Canadian Press)
(BC-Tamil-Protests)
About 100 demonstrators gathered in Vancouver to show support for the Tamil migrants who arrived by ship in B-C earlier this month.
The 500 migrants are being detained while their claims are processed.
The demonstrators in Vancouver, and those at similar rallies across the country, urged authorities to treat the migrants with compassion.
In Toronto, demonstrators draped a banner at an overpass that said ''Tamil Migrants Welcome'' at an overpass.
Rallies organized by a group called ''No one is Illegal'' are planned for later this month in Ottawa, Montreal and Kitchener, Ontario. (CTV, CKNW)
(BC-Boil-Water-Advisory)
White Rock residents are being told to boil their drinking water after E. coli bacteria were discovered in the water treatment system.
The Fraser Health Authority says water should be boiled for at least one minute if it's to be used for drinking, brushing teeth or preparing baby formula.
It says Epcor, the company that runs the treatment plant, hasn't detected the source of the contamination but is flushing the system.
About 80 homes in south Surrey are also affected by the boil water notice. (The Canadian Press)
(BC-Missing-Plane)
Smoke from B-C's wildfires is said to be hindering the search for a missing plane east of Penticton.
The Piper P-A-24 Comanche was carrying four men when it disappeared last Tuesday.
Thick smoke in the area has reduced visibility, and aircraft involved in the search for the Piper are also having to keep a sharp eye out for planes battling the fires.
Friends of the missing men are offering a 10-thousand-dollar reward to anyone who finds them. (Kelowna Daily News)
(BC-Counterattack-Oops)
A 22-year-old man accused of trying evade police at a Counterattack checkpoint in Langley is in serious trouble.
Police say the man drove straight at a Mountie, but the officer was able to jump out of the way just in time.
The vehicle then went through a red light and crashed into a lamp post and a fence.
The driver was later treated for non life-threatening injuries.
Police are recommending he be charged with assault with a weapon, dangerous driving and impaired driving. (The Canadian Press)

WHITE ROCK, B.C. - Pigeon droppings are being blamed for a boil water advisory in White Rock that's been extended again throughout the weekend.
The company operating the suburban Vancouver city's water system says it found encapsulated yeast associated with bird feces, potentially the source of e.Coli.
Epcor drained a tank holding 1.2 million litres of water on Wednesday to thoroughly inspect and disinfect it.
Testing continues on potential entry points for the e.Coli, while extensive flushing and sampling of the water distribution system continues.
The company has set up an automatic voice messaging service to call customers and update them on the situation.
Residents are advised to boil any water used for drinking, cooking and brushing teeth for at least one minute, and Epcor says they may notice a slight chlorine odour or discolouration as they fix the problem.

COWLITZ COUNTY WATER SYSTEM OWNER FACES STIFF STATE FINE

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
The owner of the Columbia Crest Estates water system in Cowlitz County has been fined $21,060 for violating state health orders to properly maintain the water system and to address ongoing problems with arsenic.
Columbia Crest customers have been under a boil-water advisory since June 2 because owner Dan Class hasn't monitored water quality and doesn't have a certified operator to run the system, as the state requires. The state Department of Health issued the penalty after the failure of attempts to work with Class to address multiple system problems.
The agency's Office of Drinking Water inspected the system in July and found numerous sanitary issues, including mold, algae, and rodent infestations in buildings housing pumps, wells, and storage tanks. In addition, significant leaks pose a contamination risk.
The system serves 22 homes in an unincorporated area between Kalama and Woodland. The Department of Health has reclassified the system's operating permit as "red," which means the system is inadequate. This can affect decisions by local building officials and financial institutions about properties served by this water system.
Class did not comply with state health orders to:
- Hire a professional engineer and submit construction documents for an arsenic removal system to the Department of Health by May 15.
- Hire a certified water system operator by July 13 to run and maintain the system.
- Employ a professional engineer by July 20 to prepare a formal water system plan. These state-mandated plans require owners to demonstrate their technical, managerial and financial ability to maintain a safe and reliable water system.
"He has been given every chance to meet requirements designed to protect the health of his customers," said Clark Halvorson, manager of Southwest operations for the Office of Drinking Water. "We would much rather work cooperatively with water system operators and owners. Unfortunately, in this situation we've had to resort to a fine."
Class has 28 days to appeal the penalty to the agency's Adjudicative Service Unit.

WHITE ROCK, B.C. - People in White Rock, B.C. can drink water directly out of their taps again after officials lifted a boil water advisory that's been in place for 12 days.
About 20,000 people in the city and a small area of Surrey were affected by the advisory, which took effect Aug. 20 after the water became infected with E. coli.
Fraser Health Medical Health Officer Dr. Elizabeth Brodkin says the water is now safe to drink but people are being told to flush out their pipes by running the water for at least a minute before using it.
White Rock's water is not filtered or treated in any way and is provided by a private company called EPCOR, which drained a reservoir holding 1.2 million litres of water to inspect and disinfect it before refilling it.
It's suspected pigeon droppings may have contaminated the water supply.
There are no reports of anyone getting sick as a result of the contamination.

The following information was released by the state of Rhode Island:
The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) has issued a boil water advisory for customers of the Prudence Island Water District (PIWD). HEALTH recommends that water used for bathing of infants, drinking, making ice, brushing teeth or cooking be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. Bottled water may also be used.
Water system tests confirmed the presence of E. Coli in the public water supply. PIWD is working closely with HEALTH to correct the problem as soon as possible.
The presence of E. Coli bacteria indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. These bacteria can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea or headaches. Infants, young children, the elderly and anyone with a weakened immune system are at an increased risk for developing more severe symptoms. Consumers who experience any of these symptoms, even if tap water has been avoided, should call their healthcare provider.
This boil water advisory is in effect until further notice from HEALTH. Customers of the Prudence Island Water District are asked to contact neighbors who may not be aware of this advisory.
For information, contact the Prudence Island Water District at 401-835-0475. For general information about drinking water, contact HEALTH's Information Line at 401-222-5960, Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. For information on guidelines for food establishments during and after a boil water advisory, visit http://www.health.ri.gov/environment/dwq/boiladvisory.php

The following information was released by the state of Rhode Island:
The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) is issuing a precautionary boil water advisory for Middletown water customers. HEALTH recommends that water being used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, cooking, or bathing of infants should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. Bottled water can also be used.
Due to a water main break, the water pressure dropped below acceptable limits and therefore, the likelihood for bacterial contamination increases. The water system is working closely with HEALTH to correct the problem as soon as possible.
All water customers in Newport and Middletown are urged to limit water usage to allow the system to restore normal water pressure.
This boil water advisory is in effect until further notice from HEALTH. Middletown water customers are asked to contact neighbors who may not be aware of this advisory.

The following information was released by the state of Rhode Island:
The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) has lifted the precautionary boil water advisory (issued on September 4) for Middletown water customers. Portsmouth customers along West Main Road who are supplied by the Newport Water System remain on a precautionary boil water advisory. HEALTH recommends that water being used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, cooking, or bathing of infants should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. Bottled water can also be used.
Due to a water main break, the water pressure dropped below acceptable limits and therefore, the likelihood for bacterial contamination increases. The water system is working closely with HEALTH to correct the problem as soon as possible.
This boil water advisory is in effect until further notice from HEALTH. Portsmouth water customers are asked to contact neighbors who may not be aware of this advisory.
For information, contact the Station 1 at 845-5826; Julia Forgue at 845-5601; or Ken Mason at 845-5614. For general information about drinking water, contact HEALTH's Information Line at 1-800-942-7434, Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. For information on guidelines for food establishments during and after a boil water advisory, visit http://www.health.ri.gov/environment/dwq/boiladvisory.php

Authorities say a precautionary boil water advisory issued after a water main break left little or no water pressure in much of a southwestern Indiana city has been lifted.
Officials in Boonville say a nearly 50-year-old cast iron water main near Boonville City Lake ruptured Sunday. The precautionary boil advisory was the result of the drop in pressure following the break.
The advisory was lifted Wednesday.
Crews repaired the 12-inch main on Monday. The city of about 7,000 people is about 20 miles east of Evansville.

BOIL WATER ADVISORY ISSUED FOR THE CITY OF NORTON

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Norton, which is located in Norton County.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory due to a break in a water main from the water treatment plant to town, which resulted in a loss of pressure and loss of water service in the distribution system. The water main is in the process of being repaired and whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) residuals may drop to levels that are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
Once water service is restored, residents in the City of Norton served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. The city and/or KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded.

The following information was released by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources:
Residents in the Carroll County city of Glidden are being asked to boil and conserve water following a computer malfunction that caused the tower to drain Sunday afternoon.
Due to the potential for bacterial contamination, it is being recommended that the water be boiled before using for drinking or cooking or that an alternative source be used. The city is also asking that customers conserve water use. Due to the potential for bacterial contamination, residents are being urged to boil water before consuming, as well as conserving water as much as possible
By Sunday evening, the computer malfunction had been corrected and the tower was beginning to refill with water.
The boil and conservation advisory for Glidden will likely be in effect until at least Tuesday. Once the water tower has been completely refilled, pressure through the system restored and chlorine concentrations have been brought to an appropriate level, sampling will take place to make sure the water is safe and free of bacteria.
Glidden is working with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to resolve the situation.
It is recommended not to drink the water without boiling it first. Bring all water to a boil, let it boil for one minute, and let it cool before using, or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, and food preparation until further notice. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. The water may be used for bathing and other similar purposes.
General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available from the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1(800) 426-4791.

Environment Department Issues "Boil Water Advisory" for Chippeway Water System in Otero County

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau issued a "boil water advisory" for the Chippeway Water System.
NMED issued the advisory on today after bacteriological contamination (E. coli) was discovered in one of the drinking water sources for the system. NMED requires the system, located in Cox Canyon approximately 16 miles east of Alamogordo in Otero County, to notify water consumers of the finding.
This advisory only applies to the drinking water at the Chippeway Water System, and does not extend to any of the other surrounding water systems.
Consumers of the Cheppeway System are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing. The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
The NMED Drinking Water Bureau will provide technical assistance to the water system and will test the water until no further threat of contamination remains.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Joe Savage, Drinking Water Bureau District IV Manager, at (575) 437-7115.

Akron Debugging New Emergency Call System

Akron Borough is working out kinks in a new emergency notification system, following the first test of its automated calling program in August.
Several residents complained at a borough council meeting Sept. 13 that they were not contacted by the Swiftreach notification system when the borough issued a boil-water advisory on Aug. 12. One of the borough's wells tested positive for E. coli, and officials said about 80 percent of Akron's water customers were alerted to the problem by phone via the Swiftreach program.
But Council Vice President Terry Reber and Borough Manager Dan Guers acknowledged Sept. 13 that the system had problems reaching land lines with call blocking or answering machine services.
"The Swiftreach notification system is one that didn't exist for us six months ago," Reber said. "Until you use it in real-world conditions for the very first time, you don't know where the bugs are."
Officials asked those who were not contacted during the water emergency to call the borough or check the Akron Web site to update their contact information. Those who have disconnected landlines associated with their water accounts can provide a cell phone or e-mail addresses to be used by the system in the future.
Guers said the borough continued with all requirements to notify residents of the boil-water advisory, alerting the public through the media, fliers and the borough sign.
In other news, the borough's vacancy board appointed John Taylor of South Eight Street to fill the remainder of John Williamson's council term. Williamson resigned his seat last month to travel to Nepal for three years on behalf of the Mennonite Central Committee. Taylor, a truck sales specialist, has lived in Akron since 1990.
Council also approved a new ordinance establishing a boroughwide 25 mph speed limit. The new limit does not apply to Rothsville or North Farmersville roads, which will retain their 40 mph speed limits, or Seventh Street, which is posted at 35 mph. The private Lions Lane, which is the access lane to Loyd H. Roland Memorial Park, also will retain its 15 mph limit.
Council approved the speed change unanimously after months of consideration. Residents from several neighborhoods, particularly those near community parks, had complained that 35 mph limits were unreasonable and hard to enforce.

Coal Grove proposing new fee

Sept. 23--COAL GROVE -- The Coal Grove Village Council had its first reading of a proposal to add a $5 user fee to each utility customer's bill on Tuesday.
The council said the fee would be used to pay back an EPA loan that they are applying for to fix water lines and to make water plant upgrades.
"The EPA won't give out loans unless they know they'll get their money back," said Mayor Larry McDaniel.
Clerk Deborah Fields said that the village would be awarded $490,000 if they can complete the application process with something in place to show that the money could be repaid.
According to Fields, 40 percent of the $490,000 would be a grant, while the other 60 percent is a loan. The loan would be a 30-year loan with a 2 percent interest rate.
"We've got to have something in place," Fields said. "Our water fund is very low. It takes everything that comes in to operate."
The water line that would be replaced with the stimulus money is over 40 years old and full of holes, said Fields.
Council member Bob Markins said that the current, quarter-inch line that runs from the water plant to the water tank would be replaced with a more durable one-inch line.
He said that the new water line would be made for higher pressure and would hold up to more abuse before rupturing.
"You can either Band-Aid it or fix it right," said Markins. "A Band-Aid will be more expensive in the long run."
The current water lines are compromised with many holes and leaks, said the council.
"We can't keep up with the leaks," said Markins.
The frequent leaks and breaks result in boil water advisories. The most recent was issued last Wednesday after a water main break, and wasn't lifted until Tuesday.
The council will have two more readings on the proposed fee before it may be passed. The next meetings will be held at 7 p.m. on Oct. 5 and 19 at the Village Hall.

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
The boil-water advisory issued last Thursday for Riverbend Homesites in eastern King County ended today.
The state Department of Health issued the advisory as a precaution because E. coli bacteria were detected in routine monitoring samples. Since those initial tests, the water system operator took 11 more samples. All of the samples were good, indicating the water meets federal drinking water standards.
"Our priority is to ensure safe and reliable drinking water," said Bob James, manager of northwest operations for the agency's Office of Drinking Water. "We're pleased that the samples came back satisfactory, and we appreciate residents' understanding as we worked through this."
The Riverbend Homesites development has 533 homes and about 1,600 residents. It's near Interstate 90 Exit 32, east of North Bend. The advisory did not affect any other communities.

The state Department of Health issued the advisory as a precaution because E. coli bacteria were detected in routine monitoring samples. Since those initial tests, the water system operator took 11 more samples. All of the samples were good, indicating the water meets federal drinking water standards.
"Our priority is to ensure safe and reliable drinking water," said Bob James, manager of northwest operations for the agency's Office of Drinking Water. "We're pleased that the samples came back satisfactory, and we appreciate residents' understanding as we worked through this."
The Riverbend Homesites development has 533 homes and about 1,600 residents. It's near Interstate 90 Exit 32, east of North Bend. The advisory did not affect any other communities.

BOIL WATER ADVISORY ISSUED FOR THE CITY OF SEDAN
States News Service

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Sedan, which is located in Chautauqua County.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory due to a number of water main breaks which were caused by water pressure changes after bringing a new water storage tank online. These main breaks have resulted in a loss of pressure and loss of water service in the distribution system. The water mains are in the process of being repaired and whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) residuals may drop to levels that are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
Once water service is restored, residents in the city of Sedan served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. The City and/or KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded. Concerned customers may contact the City by telephone at 620-725-3193.

Oct. 03--Water quality, cost cause concern in Coal Grove
While the Village of Coal Grove considers a new user fee for water upgrades, at least one resident said she would gladly pay the increase -- if her water would improve.
"I'd pay more for better water, but we've paid more and paid more and it doesn't improve none," said Tonya Compliment, a resident of Cherry Street.
At the last meeting of the village council, members heard the first reading of an ordinance that would add a $5 fee to residents' utility bills. The fee would be used to pay back an EPA loan to fix water lines and make water plan upgrades. Sixty percent of the $490,000 loan would be paid back over a 30-year period with 2 percent interest. The other 40 percent is a grant.
Compliment brought to The Tribune a mason jar full of tap water from her house. The water, a brown color, was collected in her home Sept. 29, following a water main break and subsequent boil-water advisory in the village. She had let the water run for a half hour, she said.
"I realize I'm at the end of the (water) line and I will get the bulk of the bad stuff, like I say, it's just aggravating," she said.
That brown buildup in the water is iron manganese caused by the iron water lines, Kevin Markins, water plant operator, explained. When the water is turned off and back on as it was last week, the water runs through the iron pipes, causing it to turn a rusty color.
The water lines are more than 100 years old and need replaced, he said.
"It would definitely help," Markins said of the upgrades. "We aren't going to be able to replace them all. I would like to replace every line in the village itself. They all need replacing in the village."
Markins said the village has had six boil water advisories in the past year, which is much better than some places.
When the water lines get murky, which is typically after a water main break, the only thing to do is run the water until it gets clear, he said.
Village workers typically open the flush hydrants to remove the rusty water, but not every line has one.
The village recently replaced one of its wells and installed several flush hydrants and cutoff valves, which have helped with the problem, Markins said.
"This situation with the iron was a lot worse in the 80s," he said. "Now, even though you see the black water, it has improved."
Compliment said her family goes through coffeepots every three or four months because of buildup caused by the water. The water has also ruined loads of laundry on occasion.
"I think sometimes people don't believe it when we say how bad our water is," she said.
The only way to fix the problem, Markins said, is to move forward with the fee and get the upgrades.
"If you want it to improve, we've got to come up with the money," he said.

Boil-water advisory issued for Trenton, 4 towns

Residents of Trenton and four surrounding communities are being advised to boil water before drinking it.
That's because Trenton's water plant is having problems treating water due to the high level of the Delaware River.
In addition to the city of Trenton, residents of Ewing, Lawrence, Hopewell and Hamilton are being advised to boil water.
Officials said the heavy flow in the Delaware has forced them to draw from a water reservoir reserve. That's reduced volume of treated water to only one-quarter of the normal 28 million gallons per day as of Monday afternoon.
Officials did not know when the advisory would be lifted.
The Delaware is running higher than normal following last week's torrential rains.

A boil-water advisory has been lifted for two Trenton-area communities served by the Trenton water works.
Officials said Tuesday that residents of Hamilton and Hopewell townships no longer need to boil water before drinking.
The advisory remains in effect for residents of the city of Trenton and Ewing and Lawrence townships.
The boil-water advisory was issued Monday for five communities because Trenton's water plant has experienced problems treating water due to the high level of the Delaware River.
The water level in the Delaware is unusually high after last week's torrential rains.
Officials did not say when the advisory might be lifted for the remaining three communities.

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Atchison, which is located in Atchison County.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory due to a line break on the raw water line feeding the water treatment plant. Therefore, the City is unable to treat and produce drinking water which in turn has caused the distribution system to lose pressure and run dry. When a system loses pressure it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) residuals may drop to levels that are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
The City of Atchison wholesales water to many consecutive systems. While the consecutive systems have not reported a loss of water service, they are espected to lose pressure and water service through the course of the day. As systems are affected, they should follow the boil water advisory. These systems include: Atchison County RWD 6, Atchison County RWD 1, Atchison County RWD 3, Atchison County RWD 5C, Doniphan County RWD 3 and the City of Lancaster.
Once water service is restored, residents in the City of Atchison and those affected by the above mentioned systems should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.

OLYMPIA, Wash., Oct. 5 -- The Washington State Department of Health issued the following news release:
Customers of the City of Toledo in Lewis County are advised to boil their tap water following a water line break this morning.
City crews shut down part of the water system around 10:30 a.m. in order to find the leak and begin repairs. Once service is restored, customers should boil their tap water until they're notified that it's safe to drink. Loss of water pressure increases the risk that contaminated water may be drawn-in to the system.
This advisory affects nearly 400 homes and businesses served by the city water system. The Lewis County Health Department is working with food establishments, the local medical clinic, and early-learning centers. Toledo Elementary, Toledo Middle School, and Toledo Alternative Options School are closed until the advisory ends. The advisory doesn't affect the local high school. The Toledo School District will notify parents if the closures continue.
The boil water advisory notice includes several steps customers can take as a precaution. Boiled or purchased bottled water should be used for drinking, brushing teeth, dishwashing, preparing food, and making ice. Tap water should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before use.
After the water line break is repaired, the city will elevate chlorine levels and collect coliform samples. The boil water advisory will remain in effect until the state Department of Health determines the water meets safe drinking water standards. Contact the City of Toledo at 360-864-4564 for more information.

A boil-water advisory continues for residents in Trenton and Ewing but it has been lifted for all other communities.
Trenton city officials say tests on water in Lawrenceville and parts of Hopewell have come back clear. Tests are still pending in Trenton and Ewing and residents there are being told to continue to boil water before consuming it.
The boil-water advisory was issued Monday for five communities Trenton, Ewing, Hamilton, Lawrenceville and Hopewell because Trenton's water plant experienced problems treating water due to the high level of the Delaware River.
The water level in the Delaware is unusually high after last week's torrential rains.
Officials did not say when the advisory might be lifted for the remaining two communities.
State Sen. Senator Shirley Turner has asked the Environmental Protection Department for a full investigation into what led to water service disruptions in the Trenton area.
She expressed concern that the initial treatment plant shutdown occurred on Sunday but many residents of affected municipalities were not notified until late Monday of the potential water-quality threat.
The incident shuttered schools in the area, resulted in business interruptions and created panic among residents.

Trenton Boil Water Advisory Lifted; DEP and City Pledge Close Cooperation to Address Trenton Water Issues

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release:
In order to avoid future events like the severe loss of pressure that resulted in a precautionary boil water advisory for much of Trenton Water Works' service area this week, DEP Commissioner Bob Martin announced that he and Trenton Mayor Tony Mack have pledged to work closely together to investigate this week's events and to address the challenges facing the aging water utility.
Commissioner Martin today called Mayor Mack to offer the DEP's assistance in identifying and correcting any systemic, managerial or procedural problems at the Trenton Water Works. Both the Commissioner and the Mayor are determined to ascertain precisely how this week's chain of events unfolded, and are committed to ensuring smooth operations in the future to protect public health. They are scheduled to meet Tuesday afternoon at the DEP.
Trenton Water Works, which is owned by the city, serves some 200,000 people in Trenton, Ewing, Hopewell, Lawrence and Hamilton. The utility is responsible for the treatment, delivery and testing of water, and for notification of its customers when a safety concern does arise.
"While we are of course pleased that the loss of water pressure this week did not pose a health threat, Mayor Mack and I are concerned with how Trenton Water Works handled the situation," Commissioner Martin said. "The Mayor has agreed to cooperate fully with the DEP and to correct any deficiencies that we identify. Mayor Mack and I share common goals: making sure that customers of Trenton Water Works receive a reliable supply of safe, high-quality drinking water."
Analyses of water tests confirmed that no bacteria contamination poses a threat to public health. As a result, the precautionary boil water advisory was lifted as of this afternoon for the entire Trenton Water Works service area except Ewing Township. The advisory for Ewing is expected to be lifted later tonight after completion of analysis of water samples from that community.
On Monday, the DEP ordered the utility to issue a boil water advisory as a precaution following low pressure in the system.
Preliminary information indicates that the utility temporarily closed off intakes from the Delaware River because of higher than normal flow in the river due to recent rains, but then had difficulty providing sufficient backup flow to meet demand. The utility was unable to provide sufficient flow from a reservoir that holds an emergency supply of treated water, resulting in significant and even complete loss of pressure in some parts of the system. The low pressure apparently caused corrosion in pipes to break loose, discoloring the water. The DEP does not believe that raw river water reached the distribution system at any time during the emergency.
"I appreciated the phone call from Commissioner Martin today and am eager to work closely with the DEP to ensure that operations at Trenton Water Works provide a steady and safe supply of water to all of the utility's customers," said Mayor Mack.

A boil-water advisory has been lifted for residents of the City of Trenton.
The advisory remains in effect for Ewing residents, but officials say they expect it to be lifted Thursday night if water samples test clean.
The advisory was issued Monday for five communities: Trenton, Ewing, Hamilton, Lawrenceville and Hopewell.
It came after Trenton's water plant experienced problems treating water due to the high level of the Delaware River from last week's torrential rains. The plant serves about 200,000 customers.
On Thursday, state Environmental Commissioner Bob Martin said his department would work with the city to investigate what happened and correct any deficiencies they identify.

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
Customers of the City of Toledo in Lewis County no longer have to boil their tap water. The water lines have been repaired, and lab test results received today show the city's tap water meets federal drinking water standards.
The advisory was issued Tuesday after a water line broke, causing a loss of water pressure. City crews shut down part of the water system in order to find the break and begin repairs. Loss of water pressure increases the risk that contaminated water could be drawn-in to the system.
This advisory affected nearly 400 homes and businesses served by the city water system, and involved several school closures. The state Department of Health worked closely with the city and local health officials throughout the incident.

TRENTON BOIL WATER ADVISORY LIFTED; DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, CITY PLEDGE CLOSE COOPERATION TO ADDRESS TRENTON WATER ISSUES

TRENTON, N.J., Oct. 7 -- The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release:
In order to avoid future events like the severe loss of pressure that resulted in a precautionary boil water advisory for much of Trenton Water Works' service area this week, DEP Commissioner Bob Martin announced that he and Trenton Mayor Tony Mack have pledged to work closely together to investigate this week's events and to address the challenges facing the aging water utility.
Commissioner Martin today called Mayor Mack to offer the DEP's assistance in identifying and correcting any systemic, managerial or procedural problems at the Trenton Water Works. Both the Commissioner and the Mayor are determined to ascertain precisely how this week's chain of events unfolded, and are committed to ensuring smooth operations in the future to protect public health. They are scheduled to meet Tuesday afternoon at the DEP.
Trenton Water Works, which is owned by the city, serves some 200,000 people in Trenton, Ewing, Hopewell, Lawrence and Hamilton. The utility is responsible for the treatment, delivery and testing of water, and for notification of its customers when a safety concern does arise.
"While we are of course pleased that the loss of water pressure this week did not pose a health threat, Mayor Mack and I are concerned with how Trenton Water Works handled the situation," Commissioner Martin said. "The Mayor has agreed to cooperate fully with the DEP and to correct any deficiencies that we identify. Mayor Mack and I share common goals: making sure that customers of Trenton Water Works receive a reliable supply of safe, high-quality drinking water."
Analyses of water tests confirmed that no bacteria contamination poses a threat to public health. As a result, the precautionary boil water advisory was lifted as of this afternoon for the entire Trenton Water Works service area except Ewing Township. The advisory for Ewing is expected to be lifted later tonight after completion of analysis of water samples from that community.
On Monday, the DEP ordered the utility to issue a boil water advisory as a precaution following low pressure in the system.
Preliminary information indicates that the utility temporarily closed off intakes from the Delaware River because of higher than normal flow in the river due to recent rains, but then had difficulty providing sufficient backup flow to meet demand. The utility was unable to provide sufficient flow from a reservoir that holds an emergency supply of treated water, resulting in significant and even complete loss of pressure in some parts of the system. The low pressure apparently caused corrosion in pipes to break loose, discoloring the water. The DEP does not believe that raw river water reached the distribution system at any time during the emergency.
"I appreciated the phone call from Commissioner Martin today and am eager to work closely with the DEP to ensure that operations at Trenton Water Works provide a steady and safe supply of water to all of the utility's customers," said Mayor Mack.

Area businesses use caution

Oct. 11--Many Hazleton area workers spent a stressful Sunday at work as they tried to operate businesses without the convenience of turning on a spigot and being able to use running water.
Hazleton City Authority issued a water boil advisory to most of its customers Saturday night and the advisory continued into Sunday after routine water samples tested positive for coliform bacteria. Coliform bacteria, could indicate a more harmful bacteria is in the water system so the advisory was implemented as a precaution, Hazleton City Authority Manager Randy Cahalan said.
Dan Rolles, general manager at Knotty Pine, state Route 309, Hazle Township, got to work Sunday morning and immediately set the business in motion to operate safely for the day. The same precautions he took, Rolles said, could be taken in any kitchen, whether commercial or residential, to prevent bacteria-related illness.
Rolles said food that was already washed the day before, was thrown out and as a result the business had no fresh vegetables to serve Sunday.
Rolles said he took large commercial stock pots, filled them with water and began to boil it for food preparation and cleaning.
He shut off the restaurant fountain soda machine and brought in bottled water and soda for sale with meals. Dishes, glasses and utensils were washed with boiled water. Ice cubes were made with boiled water.
Coffee making also became slightly more complicated.
Water is usually fed to the coffee maker through a water filtration system but that had to be disabled because of the advisory. Instead, workers at the Knotty Pine took empty coffee pots to a boiling pot of water in the kitchen, filled them with the steaming water and then poured it into the coffee makers or set them on burners for hot tea.
Rolles said once the restaurant figured out a routine of boiling water and then retrieving it for food preparation and cleaning, workers were able to handle their jobs and safely serice the public.
Hazleton City Authority asks customers to continue to boil water at a rapid boil for one minute and let it cool before consumption until the advisory is lifted.

Water advisory woes

Oct. 11--Hazleton City Authority implemented a boil advisory for its customers Saturday night with no timeline as to when it will end.
As of Sunday night, most of the 15,000 authority customers affected by the advisory were still asked not to consume tap water without boiling it first. Under the advisory, boiled or bottled water must be used to make coffee, wash dishes and brush teeth. Tap water is fine to bathe and wash hands in, Authority Manager Randy Cahalan said.
The boil advisory affects every person in the area that recieves a bill from the Hazleton City Authority, except for customers on the Delano/Park Place, Tomhicken and Derringer/Fern Glen systems, he said.
Cahalan said the precautionary advisory was issued when routine weekly water samples tested positive for coliform bacteria Saturday night.
The bacteria, which occurs naturally in the environment, could be an indicator that another, more harmful bacteria is present in the water supply, he said. The authority believes the bacteria could have entered the system on the south side of Hazleton as crews worked on water system installation late last week.
Regulations set by the state Department of Environmental Protection are being followed.
According to Cahalan, it's difficult to deduce exactly where and how the bacteria got into the system, though the authority has been flushing the distribution system by opening fire hydrants around where they believe the problem occurred. Employees have also increased the amount of chlorine at the treatment plant for disinfection purposes and as a precaution. Once coliform tests come back negative, the advisory will be lifted for the entire area.
Cahalan said if water isn't boiled and consumed, it could cause intestinal problems. He said if anyone experiences intestinal problems they should seek medical attention.
In the 20 years that Cahalan has worked for the authority, he has never instituted a boil advisory that covers such a large group of customers.
The authority was notifying customers of the boil advisory through an automated telephone system and via local media. Cahalan said customers will be notified when the advisory is lifted in the same way. Dr. David Sosar, authority board member, said Pennsylvania requires all authorities to notify customers by phone when a major advisory is issued.
The authority purchased automated phone services from a company last year. Sosar said this incident was the first time the system, which the authority pays an annual and a per phone call fee to, has been used. Several people outside of Hazleton City Authority's coverage area may have recieved a phone call from the system warning them of the boil advisory, however, if customers don't have service from Hazleton's authority, they are not required to boil water, Cahalan said.
Jane Danish, director of community relations at Hazleton General Hospital, said it has not seen any patients with symptoms association with bacteria in the water such as abdominal pain or gastrointestinal problems. She said the hospital also put into place its emergency preparedness plan, which meant using bottled water, boiling water and disabling ice machines.
"I think people are heeding the advisory and are doing what they need to be doing," Danish said.
Area businesses react
Sales of water supplies at local grocery stores were heavy on Sunday.
Bill Nice, manager at Boyer's, 15th Street, Hazleton, said the store would likely make it through the day with the retail water supply it had on hand. He said the bottled water section usually takes up a 12-foot space in the store and the business, which was offering water as part of a planned sale this week, also had an end display full of the beverage. Stock, he said, was also still sitting in storage room.
Thomas' Foodtown in the Churchill Mall, Hazle Township, also offered a sale on water beginning Sunday, but Assistant Manager Lauren Fisher said supplies of gallons were selling fast. She said the store still had some smaller bottles of water and expected another shipment on Tuesday. Supplies at the store, Fisher said, would probably be depleted before the Tuesday order was delivered.
Bill Biplob, manager of Heritage Fresh Foods, Poplar Street, Hazleton, said the store put in an emergency order for water that was scheduled for delivery today.
"People have been buying water left and right," he said.
The store's deli and kitchen were also following the boil advisory when preparing food and cleaning.
John Gladey, of Hazleton, was performing his normal weekly shopping at Foodtown Sunday. He peered over onto a nearly empty shelf of gallon jugs of water.
He expected to find the store's bottled water supply low and implemented a backup plan -- his daughter went to another store to find bottled water. He remembered in the 1980s when water statewide was found to possess a harmful bacteria, giardiasis, and a large boil advisory was implemented.
But Gladey believes Hazleton was one of a few places that didn't have to implement an advisory. Sosar also believed Hazleton's water tested negative during the giardiasis scare in the early 1980s.

Environment Department Lifts 'Boil Water Advisory' for El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's (NMED) Drinking Water Bureau has issued a "boil water advisory" for the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System.
NMED issued the advisory on July 23, 2010 after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for E. coli was discovered in drinking water at the water system. NMED requires the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association to notify water consumers of the finding. The El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System is located approximately 20 miles south of Santa Fe. This advisory only applied to customers served by the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association, and did not extend to any of the other surrounding water systems or communities.
Consumers of water at the El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association Water System were advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing. The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
The NMED Drinking Water Bureau provided technical assistance to the water system and determined that adequate disinfection (chlorination) is provided at a level that mitigates the potential threat to public health. The El Vadito de Los Cerrillos Water Association will maintain a regular monitoring schedule to ensure adequate levels of disinfection, and continue to test the distribution system for the presence of E. coli.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Violette Valerio-Hirschfeld, New Mexico Environment Department, Drinking Water Bureau, District II Manager, at (505) 476-8636.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release:
DEP Commissioner Bob Martin, Trenton Mayor Tony Mack and Trenton Water Works officials met yesterday afternoon at the DEP to discuss how to best tackle challenges faced by Trenton Water Works, as well as to examine events which led to last week's precautionary boil water advisory for much of the utility's service area, all in an effort to prevent future occurrences.
"I am pleased by the Mayor's eagerness to address concerns about the operations of the Trenton Water Works," said Commissioner Martin. "I want to emphasize again that the order for last week's boil water advisory was precautionary, that no untreated water left the plant, and that all of the tests showed the water was safe to drink.

Last week, Trenton, Ewing, Lawrence, and parts of Hopewell west of Route 31 were under a precautionary boil water advisory due to a drop in water pressure; Trenton Water Works service is now fully restored.

Oct. 14--A water main break on the city's southwest side Wednesday morning shut down America's Oldest Brewery and an elementary school.
At 10:15 a.m., the main broke at Sixth Street and Howard Avenue in Pottsville, causing water to flood the incline and pour down to the 500 block of Mahantongo Street.
The main was repaired by 7 p.m., said Patrick M. Caulfield, the authority's executive director.
"It was the 6-inch cross right in the middle of the intersection, a connector for four pipes, the ones coming down Sixth Street and the ones running across Howard. It blew the top of the cross right out. So we had to cut that entire cross out and put a new cross in and put in new couplings to attach the cross to the old pipes," Caulfield said.
According to Joseph Vernay, superintendent of Schuylkill County Municipal Authority, about 30 customers on Howard Avenue between Third and Ninth streets, and on Howard Avenue and Mahantongo streets between Sixth and Ninth streets were affected.
One of them was the D.G. Yuengling and Son Inc. brewery at Fifth and Mahantongo streets.
"One of the feeds going to the back of their building was affected, but they have another feed coming off of Mahantongo," Caulfield said.
Soon after the water main cracked, Richard "Dick" Yuengling Jr., president and owner of the brewery, walked down the street to talk to municipal authority workers.
"We're shut down until they fix it," Yuengling said.
At 11:30 a.m., All Saints Catholic School at 112 S. Seventh St. sent its students home early because of the situation, according to a school spokeswoman.
The authority will issue a boil water advisory for an estimated three days for customers affected by the break, Caulfield said.

MASON COUNTY: POTLATCH BEACH MUTUAL CUSTOMERS URGED TO BOIL TAP WATER

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
The state Department of Health is advising customers of the Potlatch Beach Mutual Water System in north Mason County to boil their tap water or buy bottled water. E. coli has been detected in the water system.
The agency's Office of Drinking Water is working closely with Northwest Water Systems, the system's operator, to determine the source of the contamination. Boil-water notices were distributed today door-to-door to Potlatch Beach Mutual customers.
Two other water systems in the area - Minerva Terrace and Canal Mutual - also were placed under boil-water advisories earlier this week because of E. coli contamination. The three advisories collectively affect about 160 homes and businesses.
"While we can't say these advisories are directly related, we typically see more bacterial contamination problems caused by stormwater runoff this time of year," said Clark Halvorson, manager of Southwest regional operations for the Office of Drinking Water. "That's why we encourage small water systems and private well owners in this area to test their water at least monthly in the fall in order to detect problems more quickly and take action."
The Mason County Health Department is working with area food establishments to be sure they understand the order and follow the safety precautions needed for food preparation and water service.
The health advisory includes several precautionary steps customers should take: Use boiled water or bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth, preparing food, dishwashing, and making ice. Tap water should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before use.
The advisories will remain in effect until the state health agency and water system operators are satisfied there is no longer a health threat. Customers will be notified as the advisories end.
No illnesses have been reported in conjunction with this water contamination event.
Potlatch Beach Mutual water system customers who have questions can call Northwest Water Systems at 360-876-0958. Minerva Terrace and Canal Mutual customers can call Mason County Public Utility District 1 at 360-877-5249.

HCA working out kinks in alert system

Oct. 16--Days after lifting the largest water boil advisory implemented in at least two decades, the Hazleton City Authority board of directors on Thursday asked its manager to evaluate an automated calling system and other avenues it used to alert customers of the advisory.
The authority issued a water boil advisory last Saturday night after two samples taken from a construction site along Cedar Street in Hazleton tested positive for coliform bacteria. The advisory reportedly impacted nearly all of the authority's 15,000 water customers.
The bacteria is present in the environment and could have resulted from "a stir-up in the system" or a change in flow, authority Manager Randy Cahalan said.
The boil advisory was lifted Monday.
Cahalan and authority board Chairman Phil Andras emphasized that tests detected no fecal coliform or E. coli bacteria, which would indicate that "outside contamination," or sewage, entered the water system.
"In terms of how significant it was, it was precautionary," Andras said of the boil advisory.
Cahalan said the authority detected "good chlorine" levels throughout the system. Low chlorine is an indication that disinfectants are at low levels because they are fighting bacteria -- which wasn't the case, he said.
With the boil advisory lifted, the authority will turn its attention to a Swift Reach automated call system that made three rounds of calls notifying customers of the boil advisory. The system also was supposed to notify authority customers when the advisory was lifted.
The authority also relied on local media to relay advisory notices to the public.
The authority paid $6,000 for Swift Reach's notification services in May when the state Department of Environmental Protection revised its public notification regulations. The change requires water companies to either hand-deliver water boil advisory notices or use automated telephone systems to deliver pre-recorded messages to households affected by a serious water-quality emergency.
But not all customers received calls, authority directors say.
Director Dr. Agapito Lopez said that while he personally did not receive a call, he learned of the advisory from a neighbor -- who received an automated message translated in Spanish. Director Richard Ammon said he checked system records that indicated the bulk of the calls were "not connected."
Andras, however, said the firm notified customers of the boil advisory through three separate sets of calls.
"The first time out, the bulk of the calls connected," Cahalan added. "The second and third time -- especially the last time -- results went down."
Ammon, who said he didn't receive any calls, said he wanted to know how the automated messages showed up on caller identification systems while Director Dave Sosar asked Cahalan to check if the firm met or exceeded its promise to contact at least 90 percent of customers.
"I'm not trying to belittle their work but it's a serious event that occurred," Sosar said while requesting the information.
Andras said the authority received reports that the automated system did not connect with answering machines, but that an answering machine at his home was able to record a message.
Director John Keegan said Hazleton Mayor Lou Barletta didn't receive a call -- and learned of the boil advisory when the media contacted him with questions.
Keegan contends the authority should've directed the firm to send an automated message to customers prior to an incident occurring so that customers can become familiar with the system and know what to expect.
"The larger issue is for disaster purposes," Keegan said. "We're in 13 other municipalities. We need to let every one of these governments know."
Authority members suggested taking steps to ensure Hazleton General Hospital is notified of boil advisories as well as elected officials from municipalities within the authority's service area.
Andras asked Cahalan to prepare a report that would evaluate pros and cons of the system.
Overall, the manager said the system "did what it was supposed to do."

The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality issued the following news release:
The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has advised Applewood Mobile Home Park, located in Oklahoma City, to inform consumers of the drinking water that it is unsafe for human consumption due to the presence of E. coli.
The boil advisory was issued after water samples indicated the presence of E. coli. To ensure the water is safe for human consumption, water served from the Applewood Mobile Home Park system should be vigorously boiled for one minute before drinking, use in food preparation, washing dishes or brushing teeth.
The advisory to boil water will remain in effect until the water system ensures that chlorination can be adequately maintained and that, if necessary, any required corrections to structural systems or operational practices have been made. DEQ will require that proper testing of water samples indicates the water to be free from E. coli before suspending this advisory.
Federal law requires that consumers be notified when a public water supply exceeds certain maximum contaminant levels and might be harmful to the health of consumers.

HEALTH ALERT: E. COLI DETECTED IN WESTERN HOOD CANAL WELLS PRIVATE WELL USERS, SMALL WATER SYSTEMS URGED TO TEST WELL WATER FOR BACTERIA

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
The state Department of Health urges Mason County well users along the western shore of Hood Canal to have their water tested. E. coli has been detected in the wells of three public water systems in the area over the past two weeks.
The contamination may have been caused by recent heavy rains. It's likely that more wells have been contaminated. Owners of all private wells and very small water systems (http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw/Publications/331-349.pdf), known as Group B systems, are strongly encouraged to have their water tested for coliform bacteria (   www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw/Programs/coliform.htm).
Older wells and poorly built wells are especially vulnerable to contamination.
The affected area is within 2,000 feet of the western shore of Hood Canal from the northern Mason County line south to the intersection of U.S. Highway 101 and State Route 106.
"It's very rare to find E. coli in several wells at the same time," said Clark Halvorson, manager of southwest regional operations for the Department of Health's Office of Drinking Water. "Our staff believes runoff from the unusually heavy rains early this month allowed contaminated water to seep into the water table, which may have contributed to some of the problems."
Well users and water systems can call Mason County Health Department at 360-427-9670 (ext. 400) for information about where to pick up and drop off sample water bottles. More information is on the Mason County website (www.co.mason.wa.us/health/envhealth/water_lab/index.php), the Department of Health's website (   www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw/Publications/331-242_4-21-06.pdf), and the Department of Ecology website (   www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/labs/documents/DWLabsScopesInternet.pdf).
The three Mason County water systems currently under boil water advisories are Potlatch Beach Mutual, Canal Mutual, and Minerva Terrace. The three advisories collectively affect about 160 homes and businesses.
The health advisories include several precautionary steps customers should take: Use boiled water or bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth, preparing food, dishwashing, and making ice. Tap water should be brought to a rolling boil for one minute and allowed to cool before use.
The advisories will remain in effect until the state health department and water system operators are satisfied there is no longer a health threat. Customers will be notified as the advisories end.
There have been no reports of illness from users of the three water systems.

BOIL WATER ADVISORY ISSUED FOR THE CITY OF CANTON
States News Service
October 22, 2010 Friday

Length: 367 words

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Canton, which is located in eastern McPherson County.
KDHE officials are issuing the advisory in advance of work to begin at 2 p.m. on Friday, October 22. The City will shut down water production in order to make repairs and conduct work on the storage tank and valves in the distribution system. During this time, customers will lose pressure and be without water service until work is completed. Whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) residuals may drop to levels that are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
The City anticipates work to be completed late Friday evening. Once water service is restored, residents in the city of Canton served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. The City and/or KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded. Concerned customers may contact the City by telephone at 620-628-4916.

Tajique avoids sale of its water system

The Tajique Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association borrowed $40,355 from the state last week to avoid a court judgment putting the water association up for sale.
Barb Christy, vice president of the association said, "The amount was unavailable for payment until Oct. 14, a day before the system was to be sold."
Members of the water system voted to double their monthly water rates from $20 to $40 to pay back the loan.
The association made an agreement with Frank and Loretta Dow in 2002 to drill a well west of the community, Christy said.
"The Dows did not feel the work was done according to the agreement and took the association to court on more than one occasion, and judgment was in their favor," Christy said. "We all wanted this resolved, and I am glad the problem is behind us.
Everyone needs water, and we were responsible to pay the amount."
In April the state Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau issued a boil water advisory for the water systems in both Tajique and Punta de Agua.
According to a press release, both were cited for multiple failures to test for bacteria and to meet sampling and reporting requirements. No indications of contamination were found at either site, and the boil water advisories were lifted when samples were completed.
"We have that under control now," Christy said.
The community water system was first created in 1948 and now has 60 hook-ups, she said. "Our current well is absolutely excellent. It pumps approximately 35 gallons a minute and provides good pressure for water consumers in the community."

The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality issued the following news release:
The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has announced that follow-up water samples submitted by Applewood Mobile Home Park in Oklahoma City indicate the water is free from bacteria, there is adequate chlorine residual for disinfection throughout the system, and the water is now safe for human consumption. The boil order for Applewood has been lifted.
The advisory to boil water intended for drinking or cooking was issued after initial and follow-up water samples submitted for routine analysis indicated the presence of E. coli.
State and federal regulations require that customers be notified if, at any time, public drinking water is determined to be unsafe.
DEQ is responsible for regulating more than 1,600 public water supplies in the State of Oklahoma. All public water supplies are required to regularly submit samples to DEQ for routine testing to ensure that water is safe for human consumption.

Residents in a southern New Jersey town can once again drink water without boiling it.
In a notice posted Monday afternoon on its website, Winslow Township rescinded the boil water advisory it had issued Friday. That came after high levels of E. coli bacteria were found in the water supply, but subsequent testing showed the water quality was now safe.
After the high bacteria levels were found, officials isolated the contaminated water wells, which serve about 75 percent of the Camden County community's 40,000 residents, and used chlorine to disinfect them.
Winslow's schools were closed Monday.

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
Customers of the Potlatch Beach Mutual Water System in north Mason County no longer need to boil their tap water. The water system and its well have been disinfected, and the water now meets federal drinking water standards.
Two nearby water systems - Minerva Terrace and Canal Mutual - remain under boil-water advisories. E. coli was found in the wells of all three water systems last month. E. coli also has been confirmed in at least one private well in the area.
The state Department of Health encourages Minerva Terrace and Canal Mutual customers to continue boiling their tap water until they're told the danger has passed. In addition, the agency urges private well users and very small water systems in the area to have their water tested now for coliform bacteria if they haven't already. They can call Mason County Health Department at 360-427-9670, extension 400, for information about where to pick up and drop off sampling bottles.
Unusually heavy rains in early October are likely to blame for the contamination. Older wells and poorly built wells are especially vulnerable to contamination from water runoff. No illnesses have been reported in connection with this water contamination event.
Potlatch Beach Mutual customers who have questions can call Northwest Water Systems at 360-876-0958. Minerva Terrace and Canal Mutual customers can call Mason County Public Utility District 1 at 360-877-5249.

Nov. 10--COAL GROVE -- The Village of Coal Grove issued a boil water advisory on Tuesday after a main waterline broke on State Route 243.
Coal Grove Clerk Deborah Fields said that a police officer on duty noticed water running down State Route 243 around 6 a.m. on Tuesday near the WIC Clinic.
She also said the line was too deep for a backhoe to reach. The crew working on the break wasn't able to reach the line until Tuesday evening.
"We apologize to those who are without water service," said Fields.
She also said the crew would be working until service was restored.
"Fortunately, our new cut-off valves allowed us to minimize the amount of people down to just a few neighborhoods," Councilman Nick Miller said about those without service. "The last grant we got when we put those water cut-offs in, they can now cut off certain areas and bypass and run water around to the country and everybody."
Without the valves, Fields said the entire village would have been without service.
Neighborhoods affected by the break are the Three Oaks Subdivision, part of Washington and Lane Streets and parts of Marion Pike.

MASON COUNTY: TIMBERLAKE COMMUNITY CLUB RESIDENTS ADVISED TO BOIL WATER

Length: 239 words
Byline: States News Service

Body


The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
Residents of the Timberlake Community Club in southeastern Mason County are advised to boil their water following a water outage.
A broken pipe that drained the water reservoir caused the outage. Water lines lost pressure, which may have allowed contaminants to get into the system.
Timberlake Community Club is a residential area located on Agate Road about five miles east of Shelton. The community's water system serves about 800 homes.
The water system staff has repaired the broken pipe, and will flush water lines as soon as the reservoir has refilled. Workers are collecting water samples to test for coliform bacteria. Lab tests take a minimum of 24 hours to complete. The boil-water advisory will remain in effect until tests show the water meets safe drinking standards.
In the meantime, community club managers are providing bottled water to residents. The state Department of Health advises those who choose to use tap water for drinking, brushing teeth, dishwashing, preparing food, and making ice to boil the water first. Water should be boiled for one minute and allowed to cool before use.
"I'm pleased with how well the water system responded to this situation," said Clark Halvorson, manager of southwest regional operations for the agency's Office of Drinking Water.
Residents who have questions about the advisory can call 360-427-8928.

East Bank of Orleans Parish Under Precautionary Boil Water Advisory Until Sunday Afternoon

The city of New Orleans issued the following news release:
Mayor Landrieu, Public Health officials, and Sewerage & Water Board officials addressed the media today to update citizens on the precautionary Boil Water Advisory issued for the East Bank of Orleans Parish. The precautionary Boil Water Advisory is expected to be in place until Sunday afternoon at approximately 3:00 pm, when water test results can be verified by the state Department of Health and Hospitals. This does not affect the West Bank.
"I want to stress that this is a precautionary measure and the City is following the protocol required by the state sanitary code," said Mayor Mitch Landrieu. "Based on our conversations with health officials and the Sewerage and Water Board, we are confident that the risk is low."
The State recommends that you disinfect your water by boiling it for one minute and letting it cool down prior to consumption (including drinking, cooking, brushing teeth, bathing or preparing food). Boil water for one full minute in a clean container. The one-minute boil time begins after the water has been brought to a rolling boil. (If there is a flat taste, it can be eliminated by shaking the water in a bottle or pouring it from one container to another.)
"We're uncertain at this point if there was a compromise to the system," said Dr. Takeisha Davis, Regional Medical Director at the Louisiana Office of Public Health. "The major risk is from ingestion, and we think that this risk is very low."
Davis added, "There is little risk to taking a shower, as long as individuals close their mouths and do not ingest the water. However, we recommend that individuals with open wounds or immune system deficiencies take special precautions and avoid showering while the precautionary boil advisory is in effect."
At approximately 7:00 am on Saturday, the Sewerage and Water Board's chemists and technicians began collecting 28 water samples from sites throughout the East Bank. Analysis began at 12:00 PM of all samples. Tests are being conducted at the Board's Water Purification Laboratory. Tests will be incubated for 24 hours to determine if any harmful bacteria are present in the samples. If the tests show that the water is free of harmful bacteria and has a normal chlorine concentration, the precautionary Boil Water Advisory would then be lifted with the approval of the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH).
At approximately 10:30 pm on Friday, the Sewerage & Water Board lost 25 cycle power at its main water plant, causing low water pressure (as low as 10 pounds per square inch) throughout the East Bank of the City. The Board has restored its 25-cycle power and is also operating on commercial power. According to the Board, water pressure has approached near-normal pressure, as repairs to the electrical system at the main water plant are underway. The Mayor has ordered an after action report to determine what caused the power failure.
The City's Office of Homeland Security and the State Department of Health and Hospitals are in contact with hospital, hotel, restaurant, and tourism officials to help ensure continuity of operations.
For information, citizens can log onto www.nola.gov or   www.swbno.org. Citizens can call 311 (and press zero) or 658-4000.

Much of New Orleans is under a boil-water advisory until at least Sunday afternoon, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said Saturday.
The city is waiting for test results on whether the water supply was tainted by a prolonged drop in pressure Friday night, The (New Orleans) Times-Picayune reported.
Landrieu said the advisory, issued for the east bank of the city at 3:30 a.m. Saturday and running until 3 p.m. Sunday, is precautionary.
"From a public health perspective, it's very remote that there is going to be a problem," the mayor said.
"We're uncertain at this point if there was a compromise to the system," said Takeisha Davis, director of the public health office. "The major risk is from ingestion, and we think that this risk is very low."
She advised residents with compromised immune systems or open wounds not to bathe in tap water that has not been boiled first.

The city of New Orleans issued the following news release:
Mayor Landrieu, public health officials, and Sewerage &
Water Board officials announced this evening that the precautionary Boil Water Advisory issued for the East Bank of Orleans Parish yesterday has been cancelled. Test results were verified by the state Department of Health and Hospitals.
"After following the protocols of the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Health and Hospitals, and after working with doctors, engineers, chemists and other experts, we can report that the water in New Orleans is safe and the precautionary Boil Water Advisory is cancelled," said Mayor Mitch Landrieu.
State health regulations required the precautionary Boil Water Advisory and testing because water pressure dropped below 15 psi (pounds per square inch) which increases the risk of contaminants entering the water system.
At approximately 7:00 am on Saturday, the Sewerage and Water Board's chemists and technicians began collecting 28 water samples from sites throughout the East Bank. In an abundance of caution, a second round of sampling began at 2:00 pm Saturday. Tests were conducted at the Board's Water Purification Laboratory. A 24-hour incubation period is required to determine if any harmful bacteria are present in the samples.
At approximately 10:30 pm on Friday, the Sewerage & Water Board lost 25-cycle power at its main water plant, causing low water pressure (as low as 10 pounds per square inch) throughout the East Bank of the City. According to the Board, water pressure has normalized.
The Mayor has ordered an after action report of the incident.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu says New Orleans' most widespread boil-water advisory since Hurricane Katrina will continue at least until 3 p.m. Sunday, because that's how long it will take to test for bacteria.
The advisory covers most of the city, affecting more than 300,000 people.
Landrieu says crews took water samples from 28 spots around the city's east bank but the samples need 24 hours to incubate.
Officials say the boil advisory was called as a precaution after a power failure late Friday at the city's main treatment plant including its three backup power systems caused low water pressure throughout the east bank.
Electricity was restored around midnight, and water pressure is back to normal.
The city's west bank was not affected.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu says New Orleans' most widespread boil-water advisory since Hurricane Katrina will continue at least into Sunday night.
In a statement Sunday, Landieu said the samples taken Saturday night at 28 sites on the East Bank required a 24-hour incubation period to determine if any harmful bacteria were present.
The advisory covers most of the city, affecting more than 300,000 people.
Officials say the boil advisory was called as a precaution after a power failure late Friday at the city's main treatment plant including its three backup power systems caused low water pressure throughout the east bank.
Electricity was restored around midnight Friday, and water pressure is back to normal.
The city's west bank was not affected.

The city of New Orleans issued the following news release:
Today, Mayor Landrieu and Sewerage & Water Board officials presented their after-action report following this past weekend's water pressure loss and precautionary boil water advisory on the East Bank of Orleans Parish.
"As this reports shows, all federal and state protocol and procedures were followed," said Mayor Landrieu. "As a consequence, risk to public health was minimized and no illnesses were reported. We are pleased to announce that a new allocation of $3 million from FEMA will provide total rehabilitation of pumps at two critical stations on the East Bank."
Residents and businesses on the East Bank will receive a two-day credit adjustment on their next water bills. S&WB will include a two-day credit adjustment for the average of two-days of usage during the next billing period. The adjustment is for water service only, as sewer service was not interrupted.
At 10:28 pm on Friday, November 19, 2010, operators and engineers manning the Sewerage and Water Board's (S&WB) Carrollton Water Treatment Plant heard loud popping sounds and steam began to fill the boiler room. Interior tubing had broken inside of a boiler, causing the sudden failure of this critical piece of equipment. The loss of this boiler triggered a cascading effect that resulted in the shut down of three of the four pumps moving water to the East Bank of Orleans Parish.
The skilled operators and engineers at S&WB worked well throughout the emergency. They restored four operating pumps at 12:45 am Saturday, within two and half hours of the initial boiler failure. They brought water pressure back to normal levels at 11:17pm on Saturday.
Throughout the incident, water treatment processes at the Carrollton Water Treatment Plant were not affected and finished water entering the distribution system met all water quality regulatory requirements.
The City is again encouraging residents to sign up for NOLAReady text alerts. These text alerts have proven to be valuable supplementary notification for the public, especially when emergencies happen after hours. The public is encouraged to sign up for alerts at www.NolaReady.info or send a blank text to NOLA4U (665248) or call 658-4000.
Other outcomes and next steps in the report include:
* To supplement regular maintenance, operators and engineers have begun the steps necessary to thoroughly inspect all critical equipment including boilers.
* The City and S&WB have put new notification protocol in place with redundancies.

The city of Hamilton issued the following news release:
Since the windstorm in September 2008 from the remnants of Hurricane Ike, the City of Hamilton has been installing permanent back-up power generators at our water system pumping stations. We have recently completed the installation of our third such generator and have purchased several portable generators. The South Water Treatment Plant in Fairfield has a large generator capable of not only supplying power to the plant but also can supply power to our electric distribution system during peak electric demands. We have successfully utilized the generators already in place during recent power outages. Without these generators, we would not be able to pump water throughout our system during extended power outages which in turn could cause water outages, boil advisories and greatly limit health & fire protection.
The goal is that by the end of 2011 the entire water system will be able to operate using generators in the event of a power outage. Once the installation of the generators is completed, the city will conduct exercises simulating a citywide power outage and operate the entire water system on the generators.
These installations have been a combined effort by our Water Production and Utility Electrical Systems Divisions. Most of the design, engineering, installation, and purchasing of equipment for these projects was performed in-house by City personnel providing a savings of thousands of dollars for the water customer. We continue to maintain and upgrade various aspects of the water system in an effort to provide high quality water at the lowest practical cost.

Commentary: Crash and learn

Orleans Parish Civil District Court is still sorting out the mess following an Oct. 26 computer system crash. It resulted in a loss of data that researchers need access to to complete real estate transactions.
Meanwhile, title attorneys and Realtors are closing deals conditionally when possible, and some purchases have been delayed indefinitely. While Clerk of Court Dale Atkins says most of the data has been restored, the index for the complete record system must be rebuilt. Without it, there's no way to navigate the existing or restored records.
It's no secret New Orleans lacks the technical infrastructure that is standard in many of its peer cities, but that such a catastrophic collapse took place demands accountability. A critical business sector essentially has been brought to a jarring halt, and it simply isn't good enough to fix what was broken and move forward.
The situation calls for a post-mortem investigation, with a detailed plan of action for how the court will ensure such a meltdown never occurs again. The city just conducted a similar evaluation following a breakdown at the East Bank water treatment facility that led to a boil-water advisory for most residents for nearly two days.
For real estate professionals, the shutdown of mortgage and conveyance records is comparable. Their access to vital information has been down for more than a month, a drought the industry can hardly afford to let linger.
It's easy, almost a habit in New Orleans, to point the finger of blame on years of negligence. But that's no longer an acceptable excuse in a day and age when technological resources are easily accessible. No one expects the Orleans Civil District Court to reinvent the wheel when it comes to official real estate records, but it's not asking too much for our wheel to at least be able to roll. Right now, it's not.
But we caution those in the real estate industry from turning to Baton Rouge for help. Title attorneys and Realtors have called upon Gov. Bobby Jindal to declare a state of emergency in Orleans Parish, triggering a call for outside experts to put the system back together again.
For starters, there's no indication the governor is interested in the real estate records issue in New Orleans or capable of crafting a solution. Also, Atkins is already using resources from the Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court and the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office to restore records.
It's a good start but far from the permanent fix that's needed.

The following information was released by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Willis and portions of the City of Horton, which are both located in Brown County. The Boil Water Advisory for the City of Horton applies to the Circle Drive area, and areas north of 15th street and west of 1st Avenue East.
The City of Horton is reporting a loss of water pressure which has affected part of the city as well as the City of Willis. Whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) residuals may drop to levels that are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
When water service is restored, residents in the cities of Horton and Willis served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use. Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
Use only boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested. Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. The City and/or KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded. Concerned customers may contact the City by telephone at 785-486-2681.

DeKalb ordered to clean up sewer; County fined for more than 830 sewage spills.; $700 million upgrades mandated; 11 percent rate increase planned.

The Environmental Protection Agency has fined DeKalb County for more than 830 sewage spills during the past five years and mandated it make repairs to its aging water and sewer system.
On Monday, the U.S. attorney general and the EPA issued a consent decree, ordering DeKalb to improve its sewer system, similar to a federal mandate made against the city of Atlanta several years ago. Failure to meet the decree could mean additional fines of up to $37,500 a day.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained copies of the consent decree and a settlement agreement, which indicate DeKalb already has agreed to make improvements. The county also agreed to pay a $453,000 fine for the spills and an additional $600,000 to clean up the South River, Snapfinger Creek and the South Fork on Peachtree Creek near Emory University.
The fine will be split between the federal and state governments.
The DeKalb County Commission today is scheduled to vote on $1.35 billion in upgrades to its water and sewer system.
The consent decree calls for about $700 million in upgrades.
County Commissioner Lee May said the vote only says when and how the county will pay, but either way, taxpayers are responsible for the bill.
The upgrades mean an average family's bimonthly bill will go from $165 to $178 this year and then continue to increase 11 percent for the next three years.
On Monday, the EPA filed a 17-page complaint filed against the county, alleging 836 sewage overflows in DeKalb from 2006 to October 2010. The spills, which are in violation of the federal Clean Water Act and the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, emanated from broken manholes and clogged sewer lines, according to the complaint.
The spills pose a "significant threat" to public health because raw sewage has high levels of bacteria that can end up in streets, yards and waterways, the EPA said.
The spills have resulted in thousands of gallons of untreated sewage, including fecal matter and industrial waste spilling into local waterways.
"Unless restrained by an order of the court, DeKalb County will continue to discharge pollutants from point sources without a permit or other authorization," the U.S. attorney's office wrote.
The 104-page consent decree orders the county to make drastic improvements in the next eight years.
The EPA released the documents after the AJC learned that the federal government has been in discussions with the county for about a year.
"The feds are looking closely," May said before the EPA's announcement. "Whenever we have sewage spills, they're watching. If we don't do it, the federal government will come in and make us do it at their prices."
DeKalb CEO Burrell Ellis attributed the spills to the county's 50-year-old sewer system, which he said is one of the oldest and largest in the Southeast. The system includes 2,600 miles of sewer lines, 55,000 manhole covers and 66 lift stations.
"These improvements will ensure long-term protection of public health and the environment," Ellis said Monday. "The consent decree provides a road map to work cooperatively with the EPA and the [Georgia Environmental Protection Division]."
County officials said they plan to work with the federal government and not fight them like Atlanta.
In 1998, former Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell signed a federal consent decree committing to $4 billion in upgrades to improve water quality. The city has until 2014 to finish the work and is currently seeking a 15-year extension for a small part of the project. Atlanta's federal decree came after a lawsuit filed by the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. The EPA and state EPD later joined the suit.
DeKalb officials said they have been trying to avoid the high costs and legal battles that plagued Atlanta by moving forward with the work, which includes 80 separate projects. County officials said they hope to take advantage of the current low interest rates and construction costs.
"Sewage overflows are a significant problem in the Southeast because of inadequate and aging infrastructure," Stan Meiburg, deputy regional administrator of the EPA's Southeastern office, said in a statement. "This agreement demonstrates DeKalb County's commitment to address long-standing sewage problems. Ultimately, this will benefit the local community and improve water quality in the Upper Ocmulgee and Chattahoochee watersheds."
In addition to the system's age, the EPA cited problems with fats, oils and greases. County officials said they will use video cameras to find these clogs and begin repairs as soon as the commission votes on the work.
In March, the county called for $1.9 billion in water system upgrades to be paid for by a 110 percent increase in residents' rates over five years, or annual increases of 16 percent. Since then, commissioners have whittled the upgrades down to $1.35 billion with a 11 percent increase in residents' rates.
Half of the work is to make the county's sewers in compliance with federal regulations, said Ted Rhinehart, DeKalb's deputy chief officer of infrastructure. A fourth of the cost will go to upgrade the Snapfinger wastewater treatment plant, which is nearing capacity. The plant has a capacity of 36 million gallons a day and currently averages about 30 million gallons a day.
"We're on borrowed time," Rhinehart told the AJC.
May, chairman of the commission's public works committee, said he recently spoke with former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, who led the effort to get a sales tax passed to pay for the city's water improvements.
This month, hundreds of DeKalb residents attended community meetings, objecting to the proposed rate increases.
"Whether you call it a rate, a fee, a fine or tax, it's still coming out of the same pocket --- yours and mine," May said.
Commissioner Elaine Boyer, the commission's lone Republican, said she wants to wait on the vote to allow residents to comment and review the decree.
"Only a third of it is mandated by the federal government. In a time of foreclosures, we need to give residents time to review these projects," Boyer said. "But residents are saying they can't afford all of this. I just don't buy this whole $1.4 billion."
Water bill increases may be in addition to a possible tax hike. DeKalb already is facing an estimated $55 million shortfall in next year's budget. Ellis will issue his proposed budget on Wednesday.
In addition to higher costs, further delaying the projects could mean boil water advisories, more leaks and other public health problems, Commissioner Jeff Rader said.
Two weeks ago, the county had to close portions of Second Avenue in Decatur after pipes broke and 40,800 gallons of sewage spilled, according to Water Department records. Last week, the county had to suspend water service for 12 hours to residents near Glenwood Road and Parkhill Drive in Decatur after a water main burst. And a rail section in Decatur is closed this week to repair a water main under the tracks.
May said these spills, along with other spills, have resulted in thousands of dollars in fines from the EPA.
"Their system has very similar problems to those the city of Atlanta has had," said Sally Bethea, executive director of the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, who sent a letter to the commission endorsing the projects. "What matters is they are moving to fix this critical infrastructure in the county. It's an investment in the future."
Like Atlanta, DeKalb's pipes are aging and don't have the capacity to meet any additional growth beyond the county's 730,000 residents, Rhinehart said. However, DeKalb's sewer system is not in as dire condition as Atlanta's, which had its storm water and sanitary systems combined. In DeKalb, the water systems are separate, which is what the EPA recommends.
Bethea said she is pleased that the Snapfinger upgrades will improve water quality in the South River, which has been closed to swimmers since the summer when tests found fecal matter and industrial waste.
The federal government will collect comments from the public in the next 30 days before finalizing the consent decree. The county must pay the fine, which will come from its operating budget, at the end of the public comment period.
What must be done
The consent decree mandates about $700 million of work, including:
*Identify overflows of untreated sewage and their causes
*Assess and rehabilitate all priority areas within 8 1/2 years
*Improve management, operation and maintenance programs to prevent future overflows
*Respond to overflows when they occur

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources issued the following news release:
The City of Richland in Keokuk County has issued a boil advisory for its drinking water system.
A major water main break early Wednesday caused the water system to lose pressure. Once pressure has been lost within a water system, there is potential for bacterial contamination, prompting the boil advisory.
It is recommended not to drink the water without boiling it first. Bring all water to a boil, let it boil for one minute, and let it cool before using, or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, and food preparation until further notice. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. The water may be used for bathing and other similar purposes.
General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available from the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1(800) 426-4791.
The City of Richland is repairing the water main, and will flush the lines and collect bacteria samples. The boil advisory will remain in place until necessary testing can take place to ensure the water is safe. The city is working with the DNR to resolve the situation.

OLYMPIA - Residents of the Marbello housing development just north of Monroe no longer have to boil their drinking water. A health advisory issued Tuesday has ended because lab tests show the water meets safe drinking water standards.
The advisory was issued after a water main broke, causing an outage. The pressure loss could have allowed contaminated or untreated water to be drawn into the system. The advisory affected only the Marbello housing development, which is off Chain Lakes Road about one mile north of Monroe. About 290 people live there.
Customers who have questions about their water service may call Iliad Inc., which operates the water system, at 206-282-4200.

Pipes, pumps trouble Big Easy; Water, sewage infrastructure slow recovery

NEW ORLEANS -- This city's post-Katrina rebuilding has revamped neighborhoods and restored streets and homes from the flood wreckage.
But one area where city leaders say recovery is falling rapidly behind is the city's antiquated sewer and water system. The 100-year-old network of underground pipes, pumps and power plants -- one of the USA's oldest -- was rickety before the 2005 hurricane's floods hit and got worse once they subsided.
The system showed its age last month when a century-old power plant that partly powers the city's water treatment system gave out, throwing the city into a two-day boil-water advisory.
City leaders say New Orleans cannot fully recover from Katrina until a massive, multibillion-dollar upgrade is made to the sewer and water system, first installed at the dawn of the 20th century. Federal rebuilding funds are paying only for a patchwork of repairs, and the city doesn't have the resources to do it alone, says New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat.
As with many other cities, New Orleans' aging infrastructure is low on the priority list in Washington, he says. "When the city is sitting on age-old infrastructure, something's going to give. That's true around the country," Landrieu says. "Congress and the federal government have not made it a priority. We're falling very, very far behind."
More than 1,000 aging water and sewer systems around the country need urgent upgrades, says Ken Kirk, executive director of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. With the passing of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the federal government once paid about 75% of a municipality's upkeep of water and sewer treatment systems, Kirk says. Today, that number is closer to 3%, he says.
The USA's drinking water supply is threatened daily, Kirk says. Cities such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Kansas City, New York and Philadelphia have antiquated systems that are in dire need of renovation. Across the country, there is a $500 billion to $1 trillion need to upgrade systems, Kirk says. Local governments should also be spending more, he says.
With the federal government in deficit-reduction mode and local municipalities battling their own budget shortfalls, that investment seems unlikely anytime soon, Kirk says.
"We are in a critical situation," he says. "If those systems break down, you go back to a time when people didn't have running water or toilets and where breakouts of major diseases like cholera were common. I don't think anyone wants to go back to that time."
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., says Congress has vastly underfinanced infrastructure. Inhofe, the ranking Republican on the Senate's Environment & Public Works Committee, says he is working on two bills that will direct more funds to such projects, but Washington's current cost-cutting climate makes it a tough sell.
The New Orleans system was installed in the early 1900s, says Joseph Becker, general superintendent of the Sewerage and Water Board. The network includes a drainage system with 23 pumps that can move 400,000 gallons a second -- enough to fill the Superdome in under an hour -- a necessity for a city mostly below sea level, Becker says. During Hurricane Katrina, the pumps took just six days to clear out the floodwaters that covered 80% of the city, he says.
The network also collects water from the Mississippi River, cleans it and delivers it to homes across the city using a power plant built more than a century ago, Becker says. That power plant gave out the evening of Nov. 19, dropping water pressure across the city and propelling city leaders to call a boil-water advisory.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved about $300 million to repair more than 1,600 miles of water mains damaged by Katrina, he says. Much more money is needed for a permanent fix, including $180 million to replace the power plant that failed last month, he says. "We feel the correct way to handle the repairs is not by simply putting Band-Aids over small sections of the system," Becker says. "The United States doesn't address their infrastructure issues. It's sort of out of sight, out of mind."
The federal government is investing heavily to revamp the city's underground drainage canals, says Stan Green, a project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans. The $1 billion project was approved in the late 1990s. It will add to the current system of canals and culverts that help drain the city during heavy storms, he says. "We've made significant improvements," he says.
New Orleans' entire water and sewer system needs an overhaul, says Bhaskar Kura, a civil engineering professor and director of the Maritime Environmental Resources and Information Center at the University of New Orleans.
The American Society of Civil Engineers recently graded the nation's drinking water and wastewater systems each a "D-" on its national infrastructure report card, he says.
"Twenty years back, developing nations would look at the United States like, wow, they have all this innovative infrastructure," Kura says. "But, as time passed, some of these infrastructures have become old, and we haven't invested enough."

New Water Line Accesses Knott County Water Source To Help Alleviate Some Of Countys Water Woes

Recent water issues for residents in the Blackey community are still of some concern to people wanting to know just how the trouble began. For areas with aging water systems or in which one community relies on another to receive water services, the scramble to restore water to the area was trying, especially when efforts to get customers back on line took place during harsh weather conditions.
Phillip Back, Chairman of the Letcher County Water and Sewer Commission said that trouble for the Blackey area was due to more than one issue. Back explained that the loss of service came to a head when a water line break in the Whitesburg area on Thursday, December 9, caused the 250-300 customers in the Blackey area to feel the effects.
For the people of Blackey, the challenge to get water into the area started well before December. "The Blackey Plant Operator broke a bone three months ago, and has been off," explained Back. "We've been buying all our water from Whitesburg. We haven't had anyone to operate the plant because they must be certified." The absence of a plant operator to help service customers started the events which led to Blackey's water loss.
Another reason in the disruption of service was actually due to the county's efforts to upgrade its infrastructurewhile at the time was considered an inconveniencelater turned out to play in the favor of getting residents back on line. Back said that Stotts Construction Company, hired to "interconnect the Knott and Letcher County system" came in on Saturday, December 11 for a road bore and completed the job Saturday night. The rail road bore helped to bring water to the Letcher County system from neighboring Knott county, and services a large area of the county including the Low Gap and Collie areas towards Isom, Jeremiah and Blackey.
To further complicate matters, a break then oc-cured in the Low Gap area, which had to be repaired. After the interconnection was made, Back said that residents had "a boil water advisory," which was lifted Sunday afternoon," December 12.
"It takes some time for lines to be completed, emptied out... you have to bleed the lines, the fire hydrants. It took time to get them done." Back explained that lines and hydrants are required to be bled whenever there is a disruption of service in order to clear the lines for consumers to use. Back added that "all the water employees, and some or all of the county's recycling employees, were involved in trying to restore service to Blackey customers as quickly as possible. Also on hand to help aid in water restoration were Letcher County Judge Executive Jim Ward and Deputy Judge Eddie Meade, who helped to bleed hydrants to get customers back on line. All this has put more than just a strain on customers who were without service. Back added that since the trouble began the cost of serving the 250-300 Blackey area water customers has "nearly doubled." According to Back, the Blackey plant has been operating in the hole for the past year and is in need of "major upgrades."
However, Back mentioned an upside to the challenges recently faced by Blackey residents which is that the water situation is "under control now" thanks to the interconnection from Knott County."
The Hwy 1410 interconnection, along Trace Fork Road, adds a 600,000 gallon water tank to the county's water supply, which Back said should supply all the lower end of Letcher County.
With the new plant located at Carr Fork Lake which has been in operation for nearly a year, Back feels that Letcher County residents should be "in pretty good shape."
Back says that they have been doing everything within their power to ensure Blackey residents have the service which they require. "The state, Division of Water, and county officials support our efforts and feel we're going the in the right direction," he said. Despite all the setbacks, a number of people have played a role in trying to provide all of Letcher County with an infrastructure that is up-to-date, giving citizens the clean drinking water they deserve.
A meeting for the water board is scheduled for Wednesday, December 22, at 6 p.m., at the Letcher County Courthouse, District Court for those interested in learning more about the issues affecting the county's water system.

2nd drop in 5 weeks at N.O. water plant

Many New Orleans homes and businesses across New Orleans lost water pressure briefly Wednesday night after the failure one of the four huge turbines that powers the Sewerage & Water Board's pumps.
Unlike a Nov. 19 failure that brought a 41-hour advisory to boil water, this one was fixed in 30 minutes, said Joe Becker, general superintendent for the board. He said a key backup pump was switched on in minutes; in November, that pump was being repaired.
Both problems affected the east bank, where most of the city is located. The west bank Algiers neighborhood has a separate treatment plant and was not affected.
Although the backup pump kept water pressure safe, the board's in-house power plant shut down for about two hours.
It was only the fourth failure since the facility opened at the turn of the 20th century. All four shutdowns were after Hurricane Katrina.
The water purification plant runs on power purchased from Entergy New Orleans. But 25-Hertz power, which was common in the late 1800s, drives the motors that keep huge pumps sucking water from the Mississippi River and smaller pumps pushing purified water into pipes serving homes and businesses.
In-house power also supports about half the city's drainage capacity via 115 miles of underground conduit, including lines that run under the river. The buried wires run from the power plant at South Claiborne Avenue near the Jefferson Parish line to many of the city's 23 drainage pump stations.
The power plant generates electricity by running tap water through enormous boilers, which create steam to run four turbines that produce 25-cycle power. Natural gas purchased from Entergy is used to start boilers and turbines, which run singly or in tandem depending on how much power the system needs.
Once the equipment is up and running, it relies on self-generated steam and a series of natural gas feeds to stay online.
Becker said one turbine was running Wednesday night. When it broke, it immediately shut down two outflow pumps. The backup pump can run either on in-house power or electricity from Entergy. It had been repaired by last week, becker said.
Becker said the broken turbine apparently failed because of an internal electrical malfunction. He said its copper wire coils probably will have to be rewound, a two- to three-month process that must be handled off-site by a contractor, he said.
Such work amounts to routine maintenance, "but we just haven't been able to afford to take this turbine for rewinding," Becker said.

Water pressure in New Orleans is back to normal after dropping for the second time in just over a month in many parts of the city.
The city's Sewerage and Water Board said a problem at one of their stations resulted in some residents experiencing no water or extremely low water pressure Wednesday night. The problem affected the entire New Orleans area except the Algiers neighborhood, which is on the west bank of the Mississippi River. But pressure was restored soon after it dropped and this time there was no boil water advisory issued.
In late November a longer-lasting drop in pressure resulted in a precautionary boil water advisory while water was tested for contamination.

The city's Sewerage and Water Board says a problem at one of their stations has resulted in some residents experiencing no water or extremely low water pressure.
The city says the problem is affecting the entire New Orleans area except the Algiers neighborhood, which is on the west bank of the Mississippi River.
Sewerage officials say water pressure at the station is "coming back up," but there's no word on when it will be operating normally.
This is the second time in two months that New Orleans has experienced such problems. In November, the city ordered a boil-water advisory when the water pressure plummeted across the city's east bank.
Mayor Mitch Landrieu has said he will lobby Congress for funding to repair the antiquated infrastructure for the sewerage and water board. Most of the equipment that failed in November was installed between 1920 and 1960.

Pinellas hopes to narrow boil water area today

About 100,000 homes are affected by a broken main
BY HOWARD ALTMAN
The Tampa Tribune
AND JOSH GREEN
News Channel 8
Pinellas County Utilities officials hope today to be able to reduce the area affected after a 48-inch water main broke in Largo on Thursday.
Some 100,000 homes had little or no water pressure through Christmas Day, creating a situation where microbes could accumulate, causing health hazards such as stomach cramps, nausea and diarrhea,officials said. They issued the boil water notice as a result.
Kevin Becotte, Pinellasutilities director, said Saturday, "We're required by law to do two days of sampling. We did one set of sampling yesterday and we got the results back today. Those were favorable. We're looking at getting the second set back tomorrow (Sunday) and we'll have the results at that time."
Results should be known this morning. Depending on what they are, officials said they may be able to reduce thearea of the boil water advisory, a news release states.
Officials can use those results to focus on problem areas and perhaps allow portions of southern Pinellas to discontinue boiling water because test samples are collected throughout thewater system.
About 38 properties -- mostly commercial, industrial and an RV park -- serviced by Pinellas County Utilitiesare without water, but it is important for people with little or no water pressure to boil water, pending test results, officials say.
Once the water main is fixed, the county will fix Belcher Road, which has been closed to traffic between East Bay Drive and Ulmerton Road.
Becotte said it will be later in the week, possibly Friday, before the road opens again. He cautioned people heading to work on Monday to avoid that area of Belcher.
The water main break is affecting water customers who do not receivewater from Pinellas and don't need to boil water.
While communities north of Belleair were not affected, some St. Petersburg residents have received reverse 911 calls warning them to boilwater, said Dave Baker, a Pinellas communications spokesman.
He said the 911 system does not always distinguish between residents of the city of St. Petersburg and those of unincorporated St. Petersburg, who use Pinellas County Utilities water.
Anyone paying water bills to the city of St. Petersburg can ignore the warning, Baker said.
The same applies to Gulfport, which buys water from St. Petersburg, Gulfport's website states.
Until the repair is made, officials urge customers to conserve water. A water distribution point is the county utilities' general maintenancesite, 6730 142nd Ave. N. The site is open from noon to 8 p.m. today.

(CHART) POTABLE WATER TIPS
If you're under the boil water order, here are answers to questions on how to and whether you need to boil water:
For how long should I boil water and what if I don't have power?
Bring water to a full rolling boil for at least one minute to kill most infectious organisms (germs). For areas without power, disinfect the tap water by adding eight drops, about one eighth of a teaspoon, of plain unscented household bleach per gallon of water and allow the water to stand for 30 minutes. If the water is cloudy, repeat the procedure. Use a container that has a cap or cover for disinfecting and storing water to be used for drinking. This will prevent contamination. If your well was flooded, boiling the water is the safest action, since disinfection does not kill certain parasites.
Can I wash my hands with tap water?
To clean your hands, vigorous hand washing with soap is fine; if you're washing your hands to prepare food, use water that has been boiled and cooled or use bottled or disinfected water with soap.
What about washing dishes or clothes?
Rinse hand-washed dishes for a minute in a bleach solution (1 tablespoon bleach per gallon of water) and let dishes completely air dry. Most household dishwashers do not reach the proper temperature to sanitize dishes, though the drying cycle of the dishwasher helps disinfect and clean dishes. It is safe to wash clothes in tap water.
Is it safe to bathe and shave using tap water?
Yes, as long as you do not swallow the water or get it in your eyes, nose or mouth. People with surgical wounds, who are immunosuppressed or who have chronic illnesses may want to use bottled or boiled water.
Can I wash off fruits and vegetables with tap water? What about making ice?
No. Use boiled water that has cooled, or water that is bottled or has been sanitized with the bleach solution.

Job may not be finished until the end of the week
From staff reports
CLEARWATER -- Crews worked most of Monday night toward replacing a 48-inch water main that burst Thursday, but the job isn't expected to be finished until the end of the week.
Belcher Road, between East Bay Drive and Ulmerton Road, is not expected to reopen until next week. The rupture opened up a 15-foot-deep hole, spanning five to six lanes.
The main ruptured at Belcher and 142nd Avenue North in Largo, prompting a days-long, boil water advisory that affected all Pinellas County Utilities customers in the southern part of the county.
The advisory since has been lifted.
Residents who buy their water from the city of St. Petersburg were not affected.
Overnight Monday, crews worked to remove the concrete surrounding the damaged main. A 26-foot-long section of replacement pipe is expected to be installed by the end of the week, said Paul Giuliani, who is overseeing the project.
Ten businesses in the vicinity of the ruptured main are still without water; workers are installing temporary water lines for their benefit.
