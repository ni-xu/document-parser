The Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued the following news release:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has rescinded a boil water advisory for the City of Overbrook, which is located in northeast Osage County.
KDHE issued the advisory on January 13 due to a break in a water main which caused the water tower to drain, resulting in a loss of pressure in the distribution system. Laboratory testing indicates no evidence of contamination, and all other conditions that place the system at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release:
The Department of Environmental Protection issued a cautionary boil water advisory today to southwestern Pennsylvania residents who have experienced a disruption in their water service as the result of widespread power outages.
The power outages were the result of heavy snowfall and have affected operations for Pennsylvania American Water, Aldrich Plant Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County and East Dunkard Water Authority. Without power, the suppliers are unable to draw and treat water from its source.
Once service is restored, water customers should boil water for one full minute before consuming water it.
Any widespread service interruption will cause a loss of pressure in water lines, which could result in bacteria entering the lines.
The suppliers alerted DEP of the issue and are now providing water from reserves. Once these reserves are depleted, customers may be without water service.
Once restored, DEP will review lab analysis of water samples taken from any system at which service is interrupted to determine when the cautionary boil water advisory can be lifted.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued the following news release:
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has issued a boil water advisory for the City of Woodston and Rooks County RWD #1 water systems, located in northeast Rooks County. Both systems serve a combined population of approximately 300 persons.
KDHE officials issued the advisory due to a major leak and subsequent repair, which caused an interruption in water service resulting in little or no water pressure. Whenever such a loss of pressure occurs, it is possible for contaminants to enter the system. Also during this time, disinfection (chlorine) levels are inadequate to protect against bacterial contamination.
When water service is restored, residents served by the affected public water system should observe the following precautions:
* Boil water vigorously for one minute prior to use.Boiling longer than three minutes may adversely affect the quality and taste of the water.
* Use only boiled water for drinking, diluting fruit juices, and all other food preparation.
* Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker. Remake ice cubes with water that has been boiled.
* Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water.
* Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled. Supervision of children is necessary while bathing or using backyard pools so water is not ingested.Persons with cuts or severe rashes may wish to consult their physicians.
The advisory will remain in effect until testing of water samples indicates no evidence of contamination and all other conditions which place the systems at risk of contamination are deemed by KDHE officials to be resolved. KDHE will notify media when the boil water advisory has been rescinded.

DEP Provides Update on Water Service Disruptions Boil Water Advisory Remains in Effect for Many

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release:
The Department of Environmental Protection reported today that water service disruptions persist for many customers throughout southwestern Pennsylvania as a result of last week's heavy snowstorms.
The department reminded residents that once their service is restored, they should remember to heat water to a rolling boil for one full minute initially before consuming it.
The power outages have primarily affected water suppliers' operations in Greene and Washington counties. East Dunkard Water Association is unable to provide water to customers in its outlying service area and Dunkard Valley Joint Municipal Authority is unable to provide water to its entire service area, which includes Greenesboro Borough in Greene County.
Tri-County Water Authority is unable to provide water to much of Scenery Hill and Richeyville, Washington County.
Service to Pennsylvania American Water customers went largely uninterrupted, so DEP has discontinued the precautionary boil water advisory in place for customers of the Aldrich treatment plant.
For Pennsylvania American Water customers who experienced a temporary loss of water service, including approximately 100 homes in the Knob Road area of California, Washington County, the supplier will make notifications when the advisory can be lifted after lab analysis of samples taken from the Brownsville system show that the water is safe to drink.
Without power, the suppliers are unable to draw and treat water from its source. Any widespread service interruption will cause a loss of pressure in water lines, which could result in bacteria entering the lines.

Bedford man charged with raping girl, 9
A Bedford man has been jailed on charges that he raped and sexually assaulted a 9-year-old girl.
Duane Hann Sr., 33, will face a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in Bedford County Central Court on multiple counts.
He was in Bedford County Jail in lieu of $75,000 straight bail.

Suppression of statements sought in Korbe case
A defense attorney for the woman charged with killing an FBI agent in 2008 is asking that her client's statements to investigators and a family services worker be suppressed.
Christina Korbe is accused of killing FBI Special Agent Samuel Hicks on Nov. 19, 2008, as he was attempting to serve a federal arrest warrant on her husband with a team of officers.
Ms. Korbe claims that she believed her Indiana Township home was being broken into, and that she fired a single shot from upstairs to protect herself and her two children.
Caroline Roberto, who is representing Ms. Korbe in the federal murder case, claims that Ms. Korbe was never read her Miranda rights.
Further, she wrote in another filing, Ms. Korbe had already invoked her right to have a lawyer present when a caseworker with Children, Youth and Families questioned her on Nov. 25, 2008, while at the Allegheny County Jail.
Ms. Roberto, who also asked that recorded phone calls made by her client from the jail be kept out of trial, has asked U.S. District Judge Terrence F. McVerry for a hearing on the issues.
No trial date has yet been set in the case.
Six animals removed from Shenango house
Police have removed six animals from a home in Shenango, Lawrence County, where they had been left without food or water.
Charges are pending against the residents of the Ellwood Road house. Two dogs, two cats and two turtles were removed. The house was full of feces and in deplorable condition, police said.
CITY
City meter readers get rest of the week off
One weather-related benefit: You probably won't get a ticket for not feeding a parking meter, if you can find a space that's not taken by snow.
Pittsburgh Parking Authority enforcement officers have been given the week off because many street meters are unreachable or inoperable, agency executive director David Onorato said Tuesday.
"There's no work for them," Mr. Onorato said of the 20 full-time officers and around a dozen part-timers. "The way the snow's piled up, the public can't get to the meters, either."
His collectors and ticket writers "can't roll the [coin collection] cans around, and the meters are half-frozen."
Police also can write parking tickets, and the absence of parking enforcement officers does not mean cars can park in tow-away zones.
Property taxes discount deadline extended
Pittsburgh officials are extending the deadline to pay property taxes with a 2 percent discount from today to March 1.
"We know that it's been difficult for some folks who prefer to pay their taxes in person to get Downtown," Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said in a news release. "Right now all of our residents have other pressing matters to address due to the storm, and this extension will give them one less thing to worry about."
Allegheny County's deadline for paying property taxes with a 2 percent discount is March 31.
New government affairs manager hired for city
The city of Pittsburgh has hired Paul McKrell, who was Mayor Luke Ravenstahl's campaign manager, as its new government affairs manager, effective Monday.
Mr. McKrell is expected to earn between $50,000 and $60,000 and report to chief of staff Yarone Zober. Mr. McKrell had been considered a potential candidate for the state House seat formerly held by Don Walko, now an Allegheny County Common Pleas Court judge. Mr. Ravenstahl's brother, Adam Ravenstahl, is running for that seat.
Website can access hot spots in city
The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership unveiled Tuesday a website designed for use on mobile devices that will use a smartphone's GPS to find nearby places in Pittsburgh to park, eat, shop, stay or live.
The website is m.downtownpittsburgh.com and is accessible on most smartphones, such as the iPhone, BlackBerry and Android.
Haiti Relief Concert to be rescheduled
The Haiti Relief Concert originally scheduled for Valentine's Day at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall in Oakland has been postponed due to the weather.
The concert featuring The Clarks, Bill Deasy, the Freedom Band and Good Brother Earl will be rescheduled for a later date. All previously purchased tickets will be honored for the new concert date.
STATE
State Sen. Robert Mellow to retire after 40 years
The state Senate's longest-serving member and Democratic minority leader is retiring from the Senate.
Sen. Robert Mellow said Tuesday that he will not seek re-election to an 11th consecutive term. The Lackawanna County Democrat's term expires Nov. 30.
Mr. Mellow, 67, says he wants to spend more time with his daughters and grandchildren after nearly 40 years of putting up with the demands of public office.
He was first elected to the state Senate in 1970.

Canonsburg care home death ruled accidental
The death over the weekend of a Kingdom Manor personal care home resident in Canonsburg has been ruled accidental, the Washington County coroner's office said.
The victim, Wayne E. Murphy, 60, was pronounced dead at 7:40 p.m. where he was found, at the bottom of outside stairs behind Mount Olive Baptist Church on Greenside Avenue. Coroner S. Timothy Warco said Mr. Murphy died of hypothermia.
The church is across the street from the personal care home, which the state has ordered closed.
The 23-bed Kingdom Manor already was slated to close after its provisional license was revoked in January by the state Department of Public Welfare.
Washington, Greene county water disruptions persist
The state Department of Environmental Protection said water disruptions due to the heavy snow persist for customers of several public water suppliers, especially those in Washington and Greene counties.
In Greene County, the East Dunkard Water Association is has been unable to supply customers in outlying service areas and water supply has been disrupted in the entire service area of the Dunkard Valley Joint Municipal Authority in Greensboro.
Tri-County Water Authority has been unable to pump water to approximately 600 customers in Scenery Hill and Richeyville in Washington County.
Once water service is restored, the DEP said customers should boil water for at least a minute before drinking or using it in any food preparation.
On Monday, the DEP lifted its boil water advisory for customers of Pennsylvania American Water who are supplied by the company's Aldrich treatment plant, but boiling is still recommended for approximately 100 customers in the Knob Road area of California, Washington County.

Boil-Water Advisory Issued in Metaline; Filtration System has Problem

The Washington state Department of Health issued the following news release:
Residents of the Town of Metaline are advised to boil their drinking water because of a problem with the new filtration system the community is building.
Until new filters are installed next week, the treatment plant isn't able to filter-out harmful germs, such as cryptosporidium, which can cause gastrointestinal illness.
The town of 179 people has just finished building a new water treatment plant, using federal economic recovery money and a Community Development Block Grant. The town hasn't officially accepted the plant from the contractors.
The problem appears to be caused by clay from the sand-filtration system clogging-up filter bags. The state Department of Health is working closely with the community and its engineer to resolve the issue so the new system functions as designed. Meanwhile, the agency advises residents to boil for at least one minute any tap water they use for drinking, brushing teeth, cooking, washing dishes, or making ice. The advisory is expected to continue into next week.
"When you're installing new equipment and learning how to operate and maintain it, issues are bound to crop up," said Denise Clifford, director of the Agency's Office of Drinking Water. "We're working with the community to help them fix the problem, and until it's resolved we're making sure that residents know what they should do to protect their health."
Town officials urge residents to be patient.
"We're doing our best to get the new equipment working as it should," said Mayor Pete Daggett. "In the end, we're going to have a great system that will provide high-quality drinking water for years to come."

Boroughs Set Up Emergency Call; Strasburg, E-Town, Akron Water Customers Can Be Alerted 'At The Push Of A Button'

Strasburg Borough has a faster way of informing its residents when there is a water, weather or other emergency.
Swift911 is a new service contracted by the Strasburg Borough Water Authority to meet new mandates from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Elizabethtown and Akron boroughs also signed contracts for the service provided by Swiftreach Networks Inc.
Although all municipalities are required to have a notification system in place by May 10, Strasburg Borough officials got theirs up and running after traces of the E. coli bacteria were found in January in the water supply.
The telephone messaging system can handle a large volume of calls in a short amount of time, Lisa Boyd, borough manager, said.
"It works by making phone calls to specific people or areas in the event of an emergency," she said.
Swift911 downloaded 973 home phone numbers from local telephone listings, Boyd said. Of the 1,175 water and sewer customers in the borough, 30 have entered their contact information on the borough's Web site at lancaster.pa.us/strasburg_boro.
The system can contact a resident by phone, e-mail or text message in the event of an emergency, and they will receive a recorded message informing them of the problem, Boyd said.
The authority can be selective as to who receives the call, she said. For instance, it could notify customers who live within a 2-mile radius of a water main break.
Potential uses range from community bulletins such as snow days to warning people about storms, she said.
The water authority is paying for the service, which is a flat fee of $1,700 a year no matter how many times it's used, Boyd said. The borough also will continue to do a media notice about water emergencies such as "boil water" advisories.
"I think the system is going to be awesome," she said.
Swift911 also is being used by Elizabethtown Borough Water Authority.
Sarah Yarger, assistant manager of Elizabethtown Authority, said the service was recommended by the Pennsylvania Rural Water Association.
Elizabethtown has used the system several times since it was implemented in August, John Caldwell, water authority manager, said.
"The nice thing about it is that the system contacts all of our 4,300 customers in 10 to 15 minutes so we don't have to," he said.
The water authority shares the system with the borough, he said.
Roni Ryan, borough manager, said, "The borough has used the system a couple of times since its inception, most recently to notify residents of the snow emergency declared in last week's snow event. "It has served as a valuable tool to effectively and efficiently communicate with our residents."
The service is expected to begin serving Akron water customers within a month.
Borough officials said calls to alert customers will be initiated within 24 hours of any contamination or low-pressure readings.
Swiftreach Networks, the company hired by Akron, also can send a recorded message to residents in other emergency situations, reaching thousands of numbers in less than a minute.
"At the push of a button, they'll start the calling," Terry Reber, borough vice president, said at a Feb. 8 council meeting.
Reber said the company will develop a notification database using numbers customers provide for their water bills. Residents also will have the option to add cell phone and pager numbers or e-mail addresses to the call list.
The borough will pay $820 for the service in its first year, with an annual fee of $720 starting in 2011. Swiftreach will provide 500 calls for free; after that the rate is 10 cents per call.

New Holland Issues 'Boil Water' Warning

New Holland Borough has issued a "boil water" advisory for its water customers in the wake of a water-system malfunction Thursday.
As a result, the water supply has a higher chance of having disease-causing organisms, officials said in a news release.
"People with severely compromised immune systems, infants and some sickly or elderly may be at increased risk," the release said.
Water should be boiled for at least a minute, it said.
The advisory can be lifted only after an outside laboratory confirms that the water is safe to drink.
Borough officials announced Friday that one of the chlorinators supplying the water system malfunctioned, and the chlorine residual at the water's well supply was below the allowable amount.
For details, call the borough at 354-4567 or visit the borough Web page, www.newhollandborough.org.

New Holland's water is safe to drink.
Borough officials on Sunday lifted the boil-water advisory that had been in effect since Friday.
"The tests came back negative, and there's no need to boil water anymore," borough manager Richard Fulcher said.
The advisory was announced Friday after one of the chlorinators supplying the water system malfunctioned and the chlorine residual at the water's well supply on South Custer Avenue was below the allowable amount.
According to Fulcher, the borough's water supply was never in any serious danger.
"The chlorine level was barely under the limit, and we caught it as soon as we came in Friday and immediately increased the chlorine," he said. "But state regulations said we had to go with the boil-water advisory, so we did."
State rules stipulated that the borough's water had to be tested and meet quality and safety standards two days in a row before the advisory could be lifted.
A private laboratory was hired to do the testing, which was conducted Friday and Saturday, Fulcher said.
On Sunday, borough officials contacted all the major water customers, such as Eastern Lancaster County School District and local restaurants and nursing homes, to let them know the advisory had been lifted, Fulcher said.
A notice also was placed on the borough's Web site to inform residents.

Another Water Alert In New Holland; Na Small Fuel Spill On The Treatment Plant Floor Sparked The Second Warning In A Week.

They're taking precautions and "just doing the right thing," New Holland Borough Manager Richard Fulcher said Thursday.
"And both of these times could have been a lot worse."
Less than a gallon of diesel fuel fell on a concrete floor at the borough's water treatment plant, leading to a strong odor of fuel in part of the water system this week.
So Thursday, for the second time in less than a week, borough water system officials issued a warning about the system's drinking water.
Some areas of the system have detected the diesel fuel smell in the water, and you should not drink the water if it has this odor, Fulcher said.
Use bottled water or alternative sources for drinking, cooking and preparing food until the notice is rescinded, which could happen by Saturday or Sunday, he said.
The leak on the floor came from a diesel fuel line connected to the plant's emergency generator, a borough news release said.
The diesel odor is particularly present in the southeast part of the borough's service area.
It affects some 100 of the system's 2,000 water customers, including the large Garden Spot Village senior community, and perhaps a total of 1,000 people, Fulcher said.
Anyone who made ice cubes since Wednesday should dispose of them, officials said.
"For this concern, boiling the water does not remove any of the odor or traces of diesel fuel," the release said, adding that people with particular health concerns should contact their doctors.
Officials flushed the water system and shut the system's reservoir, and water testing began immediately Thursday.
Borough officials Sunday lifted a boil-water advisory that had been in effect since the previous Friday after a bacteria concern in the water.
The water-treatment plant is three miles outside New Holland, on Welsh Mountain, Fulcher said.

PLEASANTVILLE RESIDENTS LOSE DRINKING WATER; SUBSEQUENT BOIL ADVISORY IN EFFECT
States News Service

The following information was released by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources:
Residents of Pleasantville are temporarily without drinking water due to a valve break at the city's water supply plant. Once the break is repaired and water service restored, plant officials recommend residents boil water for consumption until further notice.
According to DNR environmental specialist Terisa Thomas, the city of Pleasantville was servicing a main break when another valve broke, causing significant water loss. To repair the problem, water plant officials had to temporarily shut off water service to the town.
Once water is again available, it is recommended that residents boil water before drinking or cooking or use an alternative such as bottled water, due to the potential for bacterial contamination caused by pressure loss in the system.
According to Thomas, the boil advisory is a precaution until bacterial sample results are available. The City of Pleasantville will repair the water main, which is expected to occur this afternoon, flush lines and collect bacteria samples. Once samples have been obtained and deemed acceptable, the advisory will be lifted and the public notified.
During a boil advisory, bring all water to a boil, let it boil for one minute, then cool before using, or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth and food preparation until further notice. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water. The water may be used for bathing and other similar purposes. General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available from the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1(800) 426-4791.
For more information, the City of Pleasantville may be contacted at (515) 848-3316.

Bergen County Executive Declares State of Emergency
Targeted News Service

The Bergen County Executive issued the following news release:
In the wake of a devastating storm that downed countless trees and power lines, leaving tens of thousands of people without power or utilities, Bergen County Executive Dennis McNerney enacted a State of Emergency throughout the County. This declaration authorized the utilization of resources that are not part of day-to-day operations such as using public buildings as temporary shelters. Joining the County Executive at a press conference held today at the Office of Emergency Management were Freeholder Bernadette McPherson, William Longhi, President of Orange and Rockland Electric, Ralph LaRossa, President of PSE&G, and Dennis L. Ciemniecki, President of United Water.
"We are preparing to deploy such resources as transportation and lodging for shelters and looking for assistance from EMS and Hospitals, all due to the extended amount of power outage," said McNerney. "Further, we are opening a countywide shelter at the Bergen Community College gymnasium that will be open to residents and will remain open as long as they need it."
Bergen Community College is located at 400 Paramus Road in Paramus. The shelter will be open at 6:00 PM today. If residents cannot provide their own transportation to the shelter, assistance is available by calling (201) 368-7560. Additionally, if seniors are looking for Shelter, the county's Midland Park senior Center will be open until 10 PM and is located at 46-50 Center Street in Midland Park. If residents are stranded and need a ride, they can call Bergen County OEM at 201-634-3100.
In an effort to determine the cost associated with this weekend's storm, the County Executive asked that all municipalities conduct and submit the Preliminary Damage Assessment report as soon as possible. This will assist the State of New Jersey in requesting potential federal reimbursement.
Advisories were issued via the County's "Reverse 9-1-1" system, which can be used to immediately alert residents of all types of emergencies, including but not limited to terrorist attacks, chemical spills, escaped prisoners, missing children, flooding and blizzards.
"Due to the tremendous storm that impacted Bergen County more than 1.5 million vital emergency phone calls were made with the County's telephone alerting system to communicate boil water advisories on behalf of United Water New Jersey and on behalf of PSE&G warning of the dangers of downed power lines," said Freeholder McPherson. "These emergency calls were made as quickly as the local phone system allows. In the interest of public safety we wanted to communicate these important warnings to residents and regret any inconvenience."
The boil water advisory was issued for the following 16 Bergen County municipalities: Hillsdale, Northvale, Washington Township, Emerson, Alpine, Paramus, Dumont, Englewood Cliffs, Teaneck, Hasbrouck Heights, Carlstadt, Englewood, Tenafly, Palisades Park, Cliffside Park and Ridgefield.
In the affected towns, it is imperative that customers boil their water for one minute when drinking, cooking, baking, making ice cubes, taking medication, brushing teeth, washing food, mixing baby formula or food, mixing juices or drinks, feeding pets and all other consumption, though water does not have to be boiled for showering, washing dishes or clothes.
"I have been working with our Bergen County Office of Emergency Management since the onset of the storm," said McNerney. "There are many trees and power lines down throughout the county, as well as many intersections that are without power. First and foremost, stay away from power lines that are down." Based on the extensive damage, PSE&G is estimating that the majority of customers will be restored by Wednesday with the remainder on Thursday. To report a downed wire, call 1-800-436-PSEG.
"The safety and security of the residents of Bergen County is of the utmost importance to my administration," said McNerney. "Rest assured that we will continue to work with state, local and county officials in response to any and all lingering concerns until all issues have been resolved."
Bergen County's Housing, Health and Human Services Center in Hackensack became an emergency response center during Saturday night's storm when the high winds and rains quickly flooded and necessitated the closure of River Street. Police and County workers rescued stranded motorists and brought them to the Center. The staff at the Center provided towels, clean clothes and hot beverages to individuals who stayed through the evening.
Bergen County's Parks were also impacted by this storm. At the Van Saun Zoo, a tree fell on the Mountain Lion Exhibit, the Budgie House collapsed and another tree fell onto the pony barn, causing damage to the exhibits but leaving their popular inhabitants safe from harm in their respective shelters.

Terre Hill Hires Firm For Automated Water Notifications

Correspondent
Terre Hill is hiring a New Jersey firm to help it meet new requirements for public notification in the event of water-contamination problems.
At its March 9 meeting, borough council authorized the use of SwiftReach Networks of Mahwah, N.J., for making automated public phone calls. The initial cost of the service is not to exceed $450.
The move comes in response to new requirements, which take effect May 10, from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Municipalities must issue public notification within 24 hours of a boil water advisory for contamination, if chlorine residual falls below minimum levels, or if other problems arise with the water system.
The call service can also be used for other types of emergencies.
In other business, council received the 2009 review of the Terre Hill Fire Company from Chief Troy Weaver.
Weaver reported that the volunteer fire company responded to 68 emergency calls last year, which was a decrease of 24 from 2008. Of the total calls in 2009, 26 calls were made in the borough, 25 in East Earl Township and 17 in other municipalities.
Vehicle accidents accounted for the highest number of calls, with firefighters responding to 13.
East Earl Police Chief Kevin McCarthy reported that during February, the department answered 10 calls for service, issued 12 traffic citations and conducted two criminal investigations in the borough.
In other business council:
nAdopted an ordinance to charge a tapping fee to property owners who connect to the municipal water system or increase the use of a property previously connected to the system. The ordinance allows the borough to enforce tapping fees in the amount of $2,500.
nAuthorized reduction of sewer charges for Glenn Ammons, 330 Broad St., in the amount of $346.50 for 49,500 gallons of water that was not discharged into the sewer system. The water leaked from a break in an underground pipe between his house and garage.
nAuthorized a contract with Patriot Energy for electric generation services for 12 months.
nAuthorized acceptance of an improvement guaranty agreement and letter of credit for $25,694 for the Alvin S. & Mable N. Martin subdivision on Vine Street. Council also accepted a stormwater-management agreement and easement declaration for the subdivision, and granted final approval for the project.
nAuthorized Robert Rissler and Mark Rissler to attend the Pennsylvania American Water Works Association conference in Lancaster at a cost not to exceed $400.

The following information was released by the state of Rhode Island:
The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) reminds Rhode Islanders that water from municipal public water systems is safe to drink. Rhode Island has separate systems for public drinking water and for sewer treatment. Flooding has had minimal effect on the public drinking water systems. If a Boil Water Advisory is enacted, this information will be posted to HEALTH's website (www.health.ri.gov). There are currently precautionary Boil Water Advisories related to the flooding at four very small public water systems: Lindhbrook Water Company, Meadowlark, Inc., Ashaway Line and Twine, and Nuweetooun School at Tomaquag Museum. People who are supplied water from these water systems should boil their water for one minute before using it for drinking and cooking until the Boil Water Advisory has been lifted.
Private wells that have been flooded (wells that have standing water around them) should be considered contaminated. Private well owners should see http://www.ri.gov/press/view/11067 for additional safety guidance.
Residents of areas where sewage treatment and pumping plants are not working properly due to flooding (Warwick and West Warwick) are reminded to conserve water whenever possible. Limit toilet flushing and showering, and avoid using dishwashers and washing machines. These appliances all drain water into the sewage treatment system. Continual use could cause sewage backup and overflow. Also, people should not drain sump pumps into toilets, tubs, or sinks. Drain them instead into your yard or storm water drains.
For additional flood safety reminders, see http://www.ri.gov/press/view/11066. For guidance on safely cleaning your home if you have had flooding, see   http://www.ri.gov/press/view/11068.

DRINKING WATER ADVISORY ENDS IN EPHRATA

Length: 221 words

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
The City of Ephrata ended its boil-water advisory today. Residents no longer have to boil their tap water.
The state Department of Health and the city issued the advisory on Friday after E. coli was found in one water sample and coliform bacteria were found in several other water samples. The advisory affected about 7,100 people, including more than 3,200 homes and businesses in the Grant County community.
The city has disinfected and flushed the water system and collected 16 water samples for testing. All of the samples were satisfactory, which shows the water is once again safe to drink. The state and the Grant County Health District have not received any reports of illnesses linked to the water issue.
The city and state suspect that contamination got into one of the city's wells. The well was shut down on Friday. It will be kept offline until repairs are made and the water is shown to be safe.
"We're pleased with the city's quick response to this situation," said Denise Clifford, director of the Office of Drinking Water. "Getting the word out about health advisories quickly and effectively is a key to protecting the public's health when things like this happen."
Residents who have questions can call the city at 509-754-4601.

NMED Issues 'Boil Water Advisory' for Tajique MDWCA in Torrance County

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau is advising customers of the Tajique Mutual Domestic Water Consumer's Association to boil their water for five minutes before drinking, cooking and dishwashing. The water supplied to adjacent areas by other water suppliers is not affected and is not subject to this boil water advisory.
NMED issued the advisory on April 21 due to multiple failures by the Tajique MDWCA to test for bacteria in the drinking water as required by the New Mexico Drinking Water Regulations. The small community water system serves approximately 180 people on the east side of the Manzano Mountains in Torrance County. NMED required that the association notify its customers and members that the water system is not meeting water sampling and reporting requirements. While there is no recent indication of contamination of the drinking water, without bacteria water sample results customers cannot be certain of the safety of the water provided by the the association.
Customers of the water system are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing. If present, microorganisms in drinking water may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, even death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
NMED is pursuing an enforcement action against the Tajique MDWCA for failure to comply with the Drinking Water Regulations.
For more information please contact Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager at (505) 476-

"BOIL WATER" ADVISORY ISSUED BY BASE OFFICIALS
States News Service
April 21, 2010 Wednesday


Copyright 2010 States News Service
Length: 1260 words
Byline: States News Service
Dateline: CANNON AIR FORCE BASE, N.M.
Body


The following information was released by Cannon Air Force Base:
by 27th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs
The following are frequently asked questions with responses:
Is the Cannon AFB drinking water contaminated?
E. coli bacteria were found in the Cannon AFB water supply on April 20, 2010 and confirmed on April 21, 2010. The positive sample was found at The Landing Zone. The source of the contamination is currently unknown. As a precaution and to ensure the safety of consumers of Cannon AFB water we have issued a Boil Water Advisory for Cannon AFB proper and Chavez West housing. THIS INCLUDES THE LOW FLUORIDE TAP ON BASE. To date, the medical group hasn't reported any illnesess associated with the contamination.
Is the Cannon AFB water system connected to the surrounding communities?
No, the Cannon AFB water system is entirely self-contained. The affected water system is limited to Cannon AFB proper and Chavez West housing (not base housing in Clovis and Portales).
Is the entire water system contaminated?
The contaminated sample was found at The Landing Zone. As a precautionary measure until we determine the extent of contamination, the Boil Water Advisory is in effect for Cannon AFB proper and Chavez West housing until further notice from the installation commander or the public affairs office. THIS INCLUDES THE LOW FLUORIDE TAP ON BASE.
How can this happen?
Bacterial contamination can occur when increased run-off enters the drinking water source (for example, following heavy rains). It can also happen due to a break in the distribution of pipe systems, a problem at the storage tank or a failure in the water treatment process. The cause is unknown in this case, but we will release further details when available.
What is being done?
The 27th Special Operations Civil Engineer Squadron and Medical Group are working hard to resolve the issue. We increased chlorine levels throughout the water distribution system to eliminate the bacteria and are investigating the cause of the contamination. Updated sampling results are expected by close of business Friday, April 23, 2010, and as soon as results are analyzed they will be released.
Is the water safe to drink?
On Cannon AFB and in Chavez West housing, you must boil tap water for five minutes to be safe for drinking until further notice from the installation commander or the public affairs office. Drinking water for pets should also be boiled.
Is the water safe for household use?
You must boil all tap water for five minutes before using for cooking, dishwashing or brushing teeth. This includes water for making ice and water treated by home water filters.
- You may shower and shave, but be careful not to drink any water
- Throw away all ice in your freezer
- Discard beverages made at home with tap water (i.e. lemonade, iced tea)
- Sterilize water containers (i.e. dog bowls, water filter pitchers, ice trays)
- Dishwasher use is not recommended, boil water to hand wash dishes
- Handwashing and showering is only OK only with antibacterial soap
- Hand sanitizer use is recommended
- Bleach tablets for drinking water are not recommended
- Bleach can be used for household cleaning but should not ingested in drinking water
- Boil water for brushing teeth, even when using mouthwash
Can I use bottled water instead?
Yes, bottled water is safe for drinking, brushing teeth and household use. We will inform you when results show no bacteria in the water system and when you no longer need to boil water or drink bottled water.
What are the symptoms I should look for?
Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, jaundice, headaches and fatigue. These symptoms, however, are not necessarily associated with disease-causing organisms in drinking water, but may also be caused by a number of factors other than your drinking water.
When should I seek medical care?
Servicemembers and dependants should call the appointment line at 575-784-2778 if you or a family member experiences nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting more than two days (children should not use anti-diarrheal medications), particularly when these symptoms are associated with a low-grade fever. Seek immediate medical care for children under three years old, anyone with a disease or illness that weakens their immune system, people who cannot take their prescribed medications due to vomiting and people showing nervous system symptoms such as slurred speech, muscle weakness, double vision or difficulty swallowing.
Should I go to the emergency room?
Go to the nearest emergency room if the person has a fever higher than 102.5F, has sharp or cramping pains persisting for more than 10-15 minutes, is vomiting blood or having bloody bowel movements, stops urinating, has urine that is dark in color or has problems breathing, speaking or swallowing. Also, go to the emergency room if the person's abdomen swells or skin or eyes turn yellow.
The Cannon AFB clinic does not have an emergency room, and emergency care should be sought at the Plains Regional Medical Center or Roosevelt County Hospital.
Who is most at risk of illness?
Some people are more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. People at increased risk include infants, young children, elderly and people with severely compromised immune systems, such as people undergoing chemotherapy, people who have had an organ transplant and people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders.
How often is our water tested for contamination?
In accordance with EPA regulations, public water is tested monthly for contamination. Cannon AFB routinely monitors drinking water in accordance with all New Mexico and federal standards. A test of the Cannon AFB water system on April 17, 2010 indicated no evidence of contamination.
A "boil water" advisory has been issued for Cannon Air Force Base and Chavez West housing. Do not ingest water without first boiling it for five minutes until further notice.
How often does the water test positive for contamination?
Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain small amounts of certain contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate the water poses a health risk. The sources of drinking water include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and can pick up substances resulting from animals or human activity. To ensure water is safe to drink, the EPA regulates the amount of certain contaminants in public water systems. For more information about contaminants and potential health effects call the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 800-426-4791.
What is E. Coli and why is it dangerous?
Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a type of bacteria naturally found in the intestines and feces of warm-blooded animals. There are many different types, and most are harmless, but some may cause illness. E. coli is commonly used as an indicator of fecal pollution of water. The EPA has determined that the presence of fecal coliforms or E. coli is a serious health concern. These bacteria are usually not harmful, but their presence in drinking water is serious because they are typically associated with sewage or animal wastes. This is generally a result of a problem with water treatment or pipes that distribute the water and indicates that water may be contaminated with organisms that can cause disease.
For questions, call 27th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs at (575) 784-7131 or the Straight Talk Line at (575) 784-6909.

Denver Eyes System For Emergency Notifications
Intelligencer Journal/New Era (Lancaster, Pennsylvania)

BY ALICE HUMMER
Correspondent
Adam Webber, Denver Borough's mayor, is advocating a public notification system that could be used to help with cases such as missing juveniles, elderly walk-aways or crimes happening in particular neighborhoods.
Borough Manager Michael Hession said the borough is under a May 10 deadline for adopting a system to notify residents quickly when a "boil water advisory" is necessary.
Municipalities must comply with new state emergency-preparedness regulations regarding the water supply. But many communities, while meeting that requirement, also are looking at using new alert systems for other emergencies.
At its April 12 meeting, Denver council agreed to place the emergency notification system issue on the agenda for the April 27 regional meeting of Cocalico-area elected officials.
Police Chief George Beever will talk with East Cocalico police officials for their input.
Denver plans to subscribe to the SwiftReach Networks notification system for one year at a cost of $660. An additional fee is incurred when the system is used to notify people of emergencies such as a boil water advisory.
In other business at the April 12 meeting, several council members and citizens commented about teenagers who are displaying verbally abusive behavior at Denver Park. The teens also allegedly move benches that are not chained onto a cement pad.
"Many people carry cell phones," Beever said. "It would be great if, while this was going on, someone would call (the police)."
Meanwhile, the municipal expansion project continues with an on-time, end-of-May completion anticipated. Council approved a $1,101 change order request to provide the addition of foil facing to the unfaced ceiling insulation as directed by the building inspector.
"If you had a fire, it would not go right to the insulation," Hession said.
After Councilman Rodney Redcay asked how the item was omitted from the architect's plans, Hession said he intended to bring the matter up at the next meeting.
In other business:
nDenver's Arbor Day celebration will be held on Saturday, April 24, at 9 a.m. at 28 N. 6th St. A tree will be planted and a Tree City U.S.A. plaque will be presented.
nAndy Boyer, Denver's emergency services coordinator, reported that he and Hession completed the county emergency services survey. Boyer is working with Denver Nursing Home to update and complete its emergency plan.
nAbandonment proceedings started for a pickup truck on the United Methodist Church parking lot.
nTwo new police officers will begin their field training the week of May 10.

The New Mexico Environment Department on Wednesday issued a "boil water advisory" for Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.
The advisory came after E.coli contamination levels exceeded the maximum allowed for drinking water.
E.coli indicates the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes and could contain disease-causing organisms.
The water system is being disinfected and flushed out.

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau has issued a "boil water advisory" for Cannon Air Force Base.
NMED issued the advisory on April 21 after bacteriological contamination that exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level for E. coli was discovered in drinking water at the Cannon AFB. NMED requires Cannon to notify water consumers of the finding. This advisory only applies to the drinking water at the base and does not extend to any of the other surrounding water systems.
Consumers of water at the base are advised to boil the water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, dishwashing and bathing. The presence of E. coli in water indicates that the water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes, and could contain disease-causing organisms. Most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, a positive test for E. coli in the drinking water supply may indicate the presence of dangerous strains of E. coli or other disease-causing organisms. These types of organisms may cause severe gastrointestinal illness and, in rare cases, death. Children, the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals are at an increased risk for illness.
Actions have been initiated to disinfect the water system and identify possible sources of contamination, establish acceptable disinfection, and flush out the water system. NMED's Drinking Water Bureau will continue to provide assistance to the water system and will test the water until no further threat of contamination remains.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 476-8638.

Environment Department Issues 'Boil Water Advisory' for Vallecitos MDWCA

The New Mexico Department of the Environment issued the following news release:
The New Mexico Environment Department's Drinking Water Bureau issued a "boil water advisory" for the Vallecitos Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association in Rio Arriba County.
Customers of the water system are advised to boil water for five minutes before drinking, cooking, bathing and dishwashing.
NMED issued the advisory on April 23rd after it was determined that the water system is not meeting the treatment requirements for turbidity. NMED requires the water system, located in Rio Arriba County about 45 miles northwest of Espanola, to notify its consumers of the findings. The water supplied to adjacent areas by other water suppliers is not affected and is not under this boil water advisory.
Turbidity has no health effects; however, turbidity can interfere with disinfection and provide a medium for microbial growth. High turbidity levels may indicate the presence of disease causing organisms. NMED sets drinking water standards and has determined that the presence of microbiological contaminants is a health concern at certain levels of exposure. If water is inadequately treated, microbiological contaminants in the water may cause disease. Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches and fatigue. However, these symptoms are not just associated with disease causing organisms in drinking water and may be caused by other medical conditions. NMED has set enforceable requirements for treating drinking water to reduce the risk of these adverse health effects. Treatment such as filtering and disinfecting the water removes or destroys microbiological contaminants.
Actions have been initiated to correct and reduce the levels of turbidity entering the water system. NMED will continue to assist the water system and help identify the cause of the treatment problem.
For more information, call NMED Communications Director Marissa Stone Bardino at (505) 827-0314 or (505) 231-0475 or Mike Huber, Drinking Water Bureau Compliance Manager, at (505) 476-8638.

The state Environment Department has lifted a "boil water" advisory it put into effect for Cannon Air Force Base last week.
The advisory was issued Wednesday after E.coli contamination levels exceeded the maximum allowed for drinking water at the base near Clovis. E.coli indicates water may have been in contact with sewage or animal wastes and could contain disease-causing organisms.
Officials say extensive testing of the water system found the contamination was isolated to one outside faucet, and that there was no evidence contamination had spread to the base water distribution system.

The following information was released by the Washington State Department of Health:
Delivering safe, reliable drinking water around the clock can be a daunting challenge, especially when problems are big and resources are limited. Each year during National Drinking Water Week, the state Department of Health honors drinking water professionals and organizations for their successes in meeting the challenges.
Drinking Water Week will be observed May 2-8 this year.
"Many of this year's award recipients overcame adversity to some extent, particularly the smaller water systems," said Denise Clifford, director of the agency's Office of Drinking Water. "It's important to recognize these outstanding individuals and organizations. They've all done a great job of keeping water safe to drink and responding quickly to emergencies."
Washington's 2010 honorees are:
Paula Brock, Pine Terrace Water Association - "Going Above and Beyond"
Paula Brock, president of the Pine Terrace Water Association on Whidbey Island, is receiving the "Going Above and Beyond" award. She had to navigate several setbacks, yet refused to give up her quest to upgrade the community's undersized, inadequate water system. The upgrades are now complete. The award will be presented at 5:30 p.m. May 3 at the community's new reservoir, 942 Yvonne Ave. near Oak Harbor.
Sunrise Beach Association Board of Directors - "Most Improved"
A few years ago, the Sunrise Beach water system on Lopez Island struggled with frequent water outages, bacterial contamination, arsenic levels that exceeded safe drinking water standards, and a continuous boil-water advisory. The board completely rebuilt the small water system. Its customers now have consistent access to safe, reliable drinking water. The award will be presented May 7 on Lopez Island.
Kennewick Water Treatment Plant - "Grace under Pressure"
The City of Kennewick faced a perfect storm last July. The Kennewick Irrigation District had a canal leak that would leave the city without irrigation water service for two weeks. Temperatures were above 100 degrees. The city also had electrical problems with pumps at its water treatment plant and water storage levels were declining. Chief operator Paul Briggs and the plant staff kept the pumps working, despite some failures, and got the city through the crisis. The award will be presented during a meeting of the Kennewick City Council at 7 p.m. May 4.
Drew Noble - "Friend of Drinking Water"
Drew Noble of H20 Management Services in Mason County is the 2010 "Friend of Drinking Water." Noble, who has served on the Department of Health's Water Supply Advisory Committee, has helped struggling water systems through technical and managerial problems. Office of Drinking Water workers said he has "a passion for providing safe and reliable drinking water...and tries to do so at a reasonable price." The award will be presented at 1:30 p.m. May 6 at the Emerald Lake Water System Pumphouse, 31 E. Emerald Lake Drive W., Grapeview.
Carl McCrary, City of Kalama - "Operator of the Year"
The nomination of Carl McCrary says it all: "One person's attitude can make a big difference in the success of the utility." McCrary, the City of Kalama's public works director, has faced challenges including flooding, maintenance issues and a significant water outage. "Carl responds very quickly to any emergency, always praises his staff and ...considers himself a true partner with us in the business of providing safe drinking water for his town," the nomination said. The award will be presented during a Kalama City Council meeting that starts at 7 p.m. May 5.
Monte Brachmann, City of Camas - "Lifetime Achievement"
Monte Brachmann, recently retired public works director for the City of Camas, will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award for his many contributions to the drinking water industry. Brachmann helped found the Lower Columbia Subsection of the American Water Works Association. He led and serves on the Washington Waterworks Operator Certification Advisory Committee and state advisory boards. The award will be presented at 10 a.m. May 13 during a conference of the state chapter of the American Water Works Association in Tacoma.
