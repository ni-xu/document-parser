OLYMPIA, Wash., Aug. 31 -- The Washington State Department of Health issued the following news release:
Customers of the Basin City Water-Sewer District no longer need to boil their tap water. The advisory was issued last Friday after potentially harmful bacteria were detected in the water.
The system has been disinfected, and lab results on water samples confirm that the water meets federal drinking water standards. A Department of Health engineer, who inspected the system on Sunday, believes the contamination was likely caused by recent repair work on one of the system's wells.
Basin City is about five miles west of Mesa in Franklin County. The water system serves about 850 people during the summer.
Customers who have questions about their water can call the utility at 509-531-6308. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at htsyndication@hindustantimes.com

CALAIS, Vt. -- Federal and state environmental teams on Wednesday investigated the extent of health risks related to damaged sewage and water treatment plants in more than a dozen Vermont towns where flash flooding has left thousands of people without electricity or potable water since Sunday.
Engineers from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the state's Department of Environmental Conservation visited several areas that had been cut off to assess the hazards, officials said. The teams were trying to determine the extent of damage to sewage and water plants in at least 13 towns, including chemical and other hazardous material spills and leaks, said Justin Johnson, deputy commissioner of the environmental department.
Three days after remnants of the tropical storm that began as Hurricane Irene spawned torrential downpours in areas rarely bothered by flooding, access in and around much of southern Vermont remained so difficult that officials were unsure how many facilities had been contaminated because they had been unable to send out inspectors until Wednesday.
''We have 13 towns on 'boil water' notice, where we know there has been some level of damage, but we don't have an exact count right now,'' Mr. Johnson said, adding that he expected the number to grow.
He said he was unaware of any illnesses from contaminated facilities.
The Vermont National Guard continued to airlift supplies to residents in 13 towns stranded by washed out roadways, damaged bridges, fallen trees and mud. A helicopter from the Illinois National Guard joined the relief effort on Wednesday, helping distribute supplies, said Mark Bosma, a spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management.
By Wednesday night, crews had completed makeshift roads into all of the isolated towns, state officials said. They reached the last, Wardsboro, population 850, in south central Vermont, just before 6 p.m.
The roads, some of which pass through treacherous mountain terrain, are accessible only by all-terrain vehicles and four-wheel-drive trucks and cannot support a large-scale evacuation of residents, officials said.
National Guard troops have been going door to door to check on residents in the sequestered towns. Gov. Peter Shumlin visited three of them by helicopter on Wednesday, asking residents what they needed and telling them to ''hang in there.''
In Rochester, one of the isolated towns, dozens of residents were eating supper in the yard of a local inn before night fell. Many had contributed food from their freezers for what has become a twilight ritual.
''The lack of power, the lack of access, have definitely made people anxious,'' said Sandy Haas, a member of the Vermont House of Representatives who lives there.
Officials say they do not know how long it will take to repair some 260 roadways and 35 bridges across the state.
In Mendon, part of Route 4, the main east-west route through central Vermont, was swept away, as were at least four historic covered bridges, officials said. Railroad tracks were also badly damaged, and Amtrak suspended service indefinitely on its Vermont routes.
When asked how soon some of the more significant repairs to the state's infrastructure might take place, Gov. Peter Shumlin noted that the start of winter was not far off. ''We are up against a time frame,'' he said. ''Snow will begin flying in 12 weeks.''
About 10,000 people remained without power in the state. Utility crews were using pickup trucks, all terrain vehicles and even dirt bikes to get to cut-off towns.
Federal officials said medical professionals had been sent to Vermont to help with emergency care.

Nearly a Week Later, Thousands in the Region Still Lack Access to Clean Water

KILLINGWORTH, Conn. -- Gurmeet Singh thought that she had squirreled away enough water. In her preparations before Tropical Storm Irene, Ms. Singh, whose house has water supplied by a private well, filled her largest pots and the hot tub to the brim. That should have been enough to flush the toilets for a couple of days if the well's pump lost power.
But nearly a week after the storm, she is still without running water. Her neighborhood continues to lack electricity, so the well will not operate. And even when the power returns, she will need to test and possibly treat the water to make sure it has not been contaminated by road oil, chemicals and bacteria carried by floodwaters during the storm.
''I have two little kids, and they are really understanding the importance of water,'' Ms. Singh, 36, said as she waited to receive water from a tanker in a commuter parking lot in Killingworth. A steady stream of people arrived for water, some after taking showers at a nearby school.
Across the New York region, thousands of people are still carting plastic jugs, soda bottles and any handy receptacle to water filling stations because they either cannot gain access to water or fear that their water is unsafe to drink. Officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are trying to test and confirm that water supplies are potable, but they say it might take several days more.
In Connecticut, the impact of the storm on water supplies has varied. Rural areas with wells, like the town of Clinton, where Ms. Singh and her family live, appear to be the worst hit because of the loss of power.
But officials across the region are urging homeowners with wells in flooded areas to disinfect them, power or not.
States generally do not regulate private well water, so residents are on their own. ''There is no real record of who might or might not be having problems,'' said Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
Water systems run by large municipalities do not appear to have been affected. But on Friday, Connecticut's Department of Public Health placed 144 small public water systems under boil-water advisories because treatment at the systems stopped for varying amounts of time when the facilities lost power.
Unlike larger public systems, many of the smaller ones, which serve no more than 1,000 customers, do not have backup generators.
The systems will remain under the advisories until tests confirm that the water is safe, said William Garrish, a spokesman for the health department. Several systems were removed from the list, but many more were added as officials surveyed water suppliers in the eastern parts of the state.
Connecticut Water, which runs several smaller systems and has two systems on the advisory list, expects to receive test results for all of its systems by the beginning of next week, Dan Meaney, a spokesman for the company, said.
In New York, the State Department of Health shut the water supply at seven public systems. Residents in parts of Clinton, Dutchess, Warren, Greene and Orange Counties were relying on water from tankers or from neighboring supply systems.
Officials in New York reported that turbidity levels -- a measure of the cloudiness of water -- were significantly higher than normal as a result of the storm. Untreated sewage has flowed into waterways that feed the state's water supplies.
The state issued 78 boil-water notices, according to Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the Health Department. Nineteen of the orders have since been lifted.
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued advisories for residents in eight municipalities.
Here in Killingworth, a bucolic town about 100 miles northeast of New York City and 10 miles north of the Long Island Sound, there were no visible signs of major damage from the storm. Fallen branches littered the shoulders of the roads, but the buildings did not look beaten by the wind and showed no signs that the weather was anything but sunny.
The tanker that was dispensing water was sitting on a lot in a quiet spot. Drivers climbed out of their cars with containers under their arms -- anything without holes. They kneeled at the back of the tank and twisted the spigot, releasing a stream of clean water -- once so commonplace.
Connecticut Water, which provided water at the site and two other locations, said people were drawing about 6,000 gallons a day from the tanker.
Cathy Gazikas, 53, of Essex, Conn., said she did not waste a drop. She said she gathered half-finished bottles from around her house and used them to fill the toilet tanks and water her vegetable garden. Still, she said she had to return each day for more.
''This is the worst,'' Ms. Gazikas said.

ISSUES IN BLACKOUT'S WAKE; Pump station failures send raw sewage to ocean, forcing beaches to be closed

Thursday’s electrical outage did more than expose vulnerabilities in the region’s power system. It also highlighted the lack of backup power at some sewer and water pump stations across the county.
Boil-water orders were issued in several San Diego neighborhoods and more than 2 million gallons of sewage fouled the city’s coastline when key pieces of infrastructure failed.
From Fallbrook to the southern edge of San Diego, utility managers scrambled to cover weaknesses in a sprawling series of pumps and pipes that deliver clean water and remove waste water.
On the whole, officials said Friday that the systems performed well under unusual circumstances but that they need more emergency generators in case a major earthquake or other disaster causes another widespread power outage. There was no major damage reported to the water utilities, which were functioning normally in most places by Friday morning.
The questions about preparedness were most evident in San Diego, home to the largest and most complex water and sewer systems in the region. Pump stations serving 10 city neighborhoods lacked power on Thursday, prompting officials to issue boil-water orders to roughly 20,000 customers in those areas. The advisories are likely to continue into Sunday, even though the pumps were all working Friday. The delay is to accommodate required water-safety tests.
State officials said San Diego appears to be the only major Southern California utility where the boil precaution was necessary, but county leaders late Friday issued a list of small rural water systems forced to take similar measures. California health regulators said there’s no rule that requires backup generators at pump stations and said the city “restored the water system as efficiently and quickly as possible.”
San Diego also suffered the only two major sewage spills reported in the region — both at pump stations that don’t have on-site emergency generators.
An estimated 1.9 million gallons spilled into Los Peñasquitos Lagoon from a pump station on Roselle Street. About 120,000 gallons leaked into the Sweetwater River from a pump station near Interstate 5 and state Route 54. Beaches in both areas were closed Thursday, and they are expected to remain closed at least into today.
“For the thousands of miles of sewage lines and the many pump stations we have, to have only two major failures is pretty good,” said David Gibson, head of the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board, which regulates sewage discharges. “But to not have the backup capacity at those stations is a concern.”
San Diego runs about 75 small sewage pump stations and nine large ones. “Where it was financially and spatially feasible, we do have those backup diesel generators, and they functioned as well as we could have hoped,” said Christopher McKinney, deputy director of the city’s wastewater treatment and disposal program.
At both problem spots, he said, the pumps are connected to electricity coming from two power substations so they can keep operating if one line goes down. He said city officials assessed the possibility of putting on-site power at those locations a few years ago, but decided it was too costly and there wasn’t enough room for the machines.
“Their absence at facilities has always been a concern,” McKinney said.
Mark Weston, general manager at the Helix Water District in La Mesa, said sewage pump stations typically have on-site backup power because of how quickly wastewater can back up and cause problems.
He said utilities often rely on mobile generators for water pump stations because water stored in reservoirs often keeps lines pressurized in the short term. When water pressure drops too far, it allows for backflow into the system from homes and businesses and creates the potential for pathogens to enter the system. That’s when state officials advise water boiling.
On Thursday, Helix deployed 15 mobile generators that prevented disruptions to water deliveries across the district’s 25 pump stations.
But it was a close call, and Weston said it will prompt a review of in-house power production. “Had the event gone on for more than 24 hours, we would have needed more,” he said. “We will look at all the decisions we made and say, ‘Should we have more generation?’?”
The story was similar in Valley Center and in Fallbrook. “Because (power) came back on before the big demand came this morning, we didn’t have any problems keeping the lines full and keeping water for everyone,” said Jack Bebee, engineering manager for the Fallbrook Public Utility District. It borrowed generators from nearby Riverside County on Thursday.
For financially strapped water agencies, the choice can be difficult. Large generators can run into the millions of dollars, and not all stations have room for them.
“The reason we don’t have them at all our facilities is that it gets very expensive,” Bebee said.
Balancing money and risk is also on the docket in San Diego.
“It’s just not cost-effective to have backup generators for all 49 pump stations to prepare for a once-in-a-generation situation,” said city water department spokesman Arian Collins.
But he said Thursday’s emergency will prompt another look at the question once the water system is back to normal.
Rural boil water orders
County health officials on Friday issued a list of rural water systems where residents are supposed to boil their water as a precaution against pathogens.
The small public water systems lost pressure in during the power outage. The boil order will remain in effect until the distribution lines have been disinfected and samples confirm the absence of bacteria in the water supply.
Affected water providers are:
— 1000 Trails Oakzanita Springs, 11053 Hwy 79, Descanso
— Alpine Oaks Estates, 3505 Alpine Blvd., Alpine
— Butterfield Ranch, 14925 Great Southern Overland, Julian
— Calexico Lodge, 40248 Old Hwy 80, Boulevard
— El Monte County Park, 15805 El Monte Road, Lakeside
— H & J Water Company, 4835 Belvedere Dr., Julian
