HOUSTON -- Hospitals across the South grappled with water shortages Sunday as the region carried on with recovery efforts in the wake of a devastating winter storm, and the weather offered a balmy respite -- temperatures as high as the mid-60s. 
At the height of the storm, hospitals were left scrambling to care for patients amid record cold, snow and ice that battered parts of the country more accustomed to going through winter with light jackets and short sleeves. The icy blast ruptured water mains, knocked out power to millions of utility customers and contributed to at least 76 deaths -- half of which occurred in Texas. At least seven people died in Tennessee and four in Portland, Ore. 
A rural hospital in Anahuac, Texas, about 50 miles east of Houston, lost water and power. 
William Kiefer, CEO of Chambers Health, which runs the hospital along with two clinics and a wellness center, said the facilities resorted to backup generators and water from a 275-gallon storage tank. They refilled it three times using water from a swimming pool in the wellness center. 
Water was restored Thursday, and operations had returned to normal Sunday, he said. 
After temperatures plunged as much as 40 degrees below normal last week, the forecast for the Houston area called for a high of 65 degrees Sunday. The city lifted its boil-water advisory Sunday afternoon. 
Memphis saw 10 inches of snow last week. Memphis, Light, Gas & Water issued a boil-water advisory Thursday out of concern that low water pressure caused by problems at aging pumping stations and water main ruptures could lead to contamination. The advisory was still in place Sunday; utility officials said they did not know when they might lift it. 
About 260,000 homes and businesses were under the advisory. Hospitals and nursing homes have been forced to switch to bottled water. The Tennessee National Guard was supplying St. Francis Hospital with water. 
Nearby Baptist Memorial Hospital has taken on some of St. Francis' patients, particularly those who need dialysis, said Dr. Jeff Wright, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Baptist. That hospital has a water purification system for dialysis and has water reserves for tasks such as cooking and bathing patients, he said. 
"We have gallon jugs of water that were already stocked and ready to roll," Wright said. 
Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare also reported problems at some of its Memphis-area facilities due to water pressure problems and the boil advisory. The system is using tanker trucks to boost water pressure and relying on help from facilities that have not been affected. 
City officials planned to distribute water bottles at several locations Sunday. Grocery stores struggled to keep shelves stocked with bottled water. Many restaurants remained closed.  
Flights resumed Saturday at Memphis International Airport after everything was grounded Friday because of water pressure problems. Some problems still lingered, but airport officials set up temporary restrooms.  
The White House said about a third of the COVID-19 vaccine doses delayed by the storm were delivered over the weekend.  
The weather created a backlog of about 6 million doses as power outages closed some vaccination centers and icy weather stranded vaccine in shipping hubs. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told ABC's "This Week" that about 2 million of those doses have gone out.  
In Nashville, Tennessee, local COVID-19 task force leader Dr. Alex Jahangir said more than 2,300 seniors and teachers got vaccinated Saturday as the city resumed offering shots after days of treacherous weather.  
Due to the wintry mess, local health officials last week vaccinated more than 500 people with doses that otherwise would have expired, including hundreds at homeless shelters and residents of a historically Black neighborhood who were mostly seniors with underlying health conditions.  
Nearly 230,000 customers across the South were still without power as of Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us, a website that tracks power outages. The largest blackouts were in Mississippi, Texas, West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. Each state had more than 30,000 customers without power.  
President Joe Biden is eager to visit Texas, which was hit especially hard by the weather, Psaki said. Biden hopes to travel to the state this week but "doesn't want to take away resources" from the response, she said. Biden declared a major disaster in Texas on Saturday.  
"He is ... very mindful of the fact that it's not a light footprint for a president to travel to a disaster area.  
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told CBS' "Face the Nation" that Biden can come anytime.  
"We certainly would welcome him," Turner said.  
Texas Rep. Michael McCaul told CNN's "State of the Union" that federal disaster relief can be used to repair burst pipes and flood damage and to help Texans hit with skyrocketing energy bills.  
McCaul also criticized fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's decision to take his family on vacation amid the crisis.  
"When a crisis hits my state, I'm there," McCaul said. "I'm not going to go on some vacation. I know Mr. Cruz called it a mistake, and he's owned up to that. But I think that was a big mistake."

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Texas. That will make federal funds available for temporary housing, home repairs and low-cost loans as the state recovers from days of extreme winter weather. Warmer temperatures are bringing some relief, for people there and in other Gulf States. In Mississippi, utility crews are hard at work to restore power to thousands of customers. Joining us now from Jackson in Mississippi - joining us now from Jackson is Mississippi Public Broadcasting's Becca Schimmel. Good morning.             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 Good morning.             
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 Tell us what it's been like there over the past few days.             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 Pretty frozen the past few days, but the sun finally came out yesterday, and more people were able to get their cars out and get on the road for essentials. Most of the state is still under a boil-water advisory, though, so a lot of the restaurants and other places are closed. I have just been able to get my car out this morning, but it was surrounded with a pretty thick layer of ice - pretty impressive.             
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 Yeah.             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 I'm lucky that I haven't lost power, though, and I've had enough water trickling out to be able to fill a kettle and boil my water. And there were a couple of days this week where I may not have had enough water pressure to take a shower, but my pipes haven't burst or anything, so that's good.             
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 That is good. And I imagine you've been talking to people in the city. What are they saying?             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 Yeah, well, since people can actually get out of their house and walk around now, I spoke with Jerrica Johnson (ph) about the storm while she was in line with her 8-year-old cousin at the grocery store. It was actually his birthday yesterday, so hopefully, he'll get to enjoy it, now that the ice is melting and the state is recovering. But Jerrica said it's been pretty tough.             
JERRICA JOHNSON:                 Not having water and stuff like that and going back and forth to the grocery store, not being able to drive, due to the ice. And things have been closed so early.             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 And down the street at the dry cleaners, Carly Kaiser (ph) is back at work after being closed the entire week, pretty much. She works in customer service, and she said she expected business to start picking back up next week. It was pretty dead when I went over there. Kaiser lost power for one day during the middle of the storm, but she's thankful it wasn't worse.             
CARLY KAISER:                 I've seen other people that have, you know, worse. They don't have water. They still don't have power and stuff like that. So I'm just thankful, you know, we have what we have.             
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 It's so hard for residents, of course, but are businesses open? How are they dealing with the water situation?             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 Yeah, well, Urban Foxes - which is the coffee shop right around the corner from me - like many food service businesses, was closed pretty much all week. They've been pretty limited in what they can offer, having to boil water before they can use it, like the rest of Jackson and really many areas throughout Mississippi. Here's Maya Miller (ph), who works there.             
MAYA MILLER:                 Surprisingly, more people have showed up today than we thought would show up. I think everyone's a little bit - you know, got a little bit of cabin fever.             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 I did see more people out and about today and yesterday than I'd really seen all week. The city of Jackson's working to deliver water to the most vulnerable population right now - the elderly people who can't get out of their houses. But ultimately, Mississippi's infrastructure was stressed by the unprecedented and prolonged winter weather.             
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 I can imagine. We've been hearing a lot from Texas about better preparing for extreme winter weather in the future. Are residents of the Gulf States having the same discussions?             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 Well, I don't think Mississippi or Louisiana officials feel that they can always justify spending money on snowplows or more road salt - not when they face the more common threat of flooding. During a press conference this past week, the mayor of Shreveport, La., said if he suggested buying road salt over more sand in case of flooding, he would be laughed out of the building. And the mayor of Jackson, Miss., agreed, but added that the problem this week wasn't really snow removal. It was ice, which the sun has much more power to solve than a plow or road salt.             
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO:                 That's Becca Schimmel of Mississippi Public Broadcasting. Thank you very much.             
BECCA SCHIMMEL:                 Thank you.

Hospitals confront water shortages in winter storm aftermath

HOUSTON (AP) — Hospitals across the South grappled with water shortages Sunday in the wake of a devastating winter storm as the region carried on with recovery efforts and the weather offered a balmy respite — temperatures as high as the mid-60s.
At the height of last week's storm, hospitals scrambled to care for patients amid record cold temperatures, snow and ice that battered parts of the country more accustomed to going through winter with light jackets and short sleeves. The icy blast ruptured water mains, knocked out power to millions of utility customers and contributed to at least 76 deaths — half of which occurred in Texas. At least seven people died in Tennessee and four in Portland, Oregon.
A rural hospital in Anahuac, Texas, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Houston, lost both water and power.
William Kiefer, CEO of Chambers Health, which runs the hospital along with two clinics and a wellness center, said the facilities resorted to backup generators and water from a 275-gallon storage tank. They refilled it three times using water from a swimming pool in the wellness center.
When temperatures were in the teens last Monday, a woman about to give birth walked into the hospital after she could not make it through the ice and snow to her hospital in suburban Houston. Emergency room staff delivered the baby safely, Kiefer said.
“It would have taken her another two hours to get to (the suburban Houston hospital) if our facility wasn't there,” he said. “We can probably assume she would have had the baby in her car and the snow. Not a good situation.”
Water was restored Thursday, and operations had returned to normal on Sunday, he said. The health system plans to look into installing more sophisticated backup systems, he said.
Houston Methodist Hospital spokeswoman Gale Smith said water had been restored at two community hospitals in the system, which was dealing with an influx of dialysis patients after their local centers closed, she added.
After temperatures plunged as much as 40 degrees below normal last week, the forecast for the Houston area called for a high of 65 degrees (18 degrees Celsius) on Sunday. The city lifted its boil-water advisory on Sunday afternoon.
About 30,000 Texans were still without power due to downed power lines and other equipment failures. Gov. Greg Abbott said during a news conference that he expected all service to be restored by Sunday night or Monday.
Abbott also said he was concerned about the threat of massive electric bills after wholesale energy prices skyrocketed while power plants were offline. He said it would be the “top priority” for the Legislature, and he vowed not to end the legislative session until lawmakers ensure that the state’s power grid is retrofitted to handle extreme winter and summer weather.
Nearly 230,000 customers across the South were still without power as of Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us, a website that tracks power outages. Other large blackouts were in Mississippi, West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon.
Memphis, Tennessee, saw 10 inches of snow last week. Memphis, Light, Gas & Water issued a boil-water advisory on Thursday out of concern that low water pressure caused by problems at aging pumping stations and water main ruptures could lead to contamination. The advisory was still in place Sunday; utility officials said they did not know when they might lift it.
About 260,000 homes and businesses were under the advisory. Hospitals and nursing homes have been forced to switch to bottled water. The Tennessee National Guard was supplying St. Francis Hospital with water.
Nearby Baptist Memorial Hospital took on some of St. Francis' patients, particularly those who need dialysis, said Dr. Jeff Wright, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Baptist. That hospital has a water purification system for dialysis and has water reserves for tasks such as cooking and bathing patients, he said.
“We have gallon jugs of water that were already stocked and ready to roll on day one,” Wright said.
Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare also reported problems at some of its Memphis-area facilities due to water pressure problems and the boil advisory. The system is using tanker trucks to boost water pressure and relying on help from facilities that have not been affected.
City officials planned to distribute water bottles at several locations Sunday. Grocery stores struggled to keep shelves stocked with bottled water. Many restaurants remained closed.
In Washington, the White House said about a third of the COVID-19 vaccine doses delayed by the storm were delivered over the weekend.

CHAIRS MALONEY AND THOMPSON LAUNCH FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR'S DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR WATER SYSTEM REPAIRS IN JACKSON

The following information was released by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform:
Today, Rep. Carolyn B. Malone y, Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves requesting information on how the state plans to distribute more than $10 billion in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $429 million that was specifically allotted to enhance the state's water infrastructure.
"We urge you to take action to protect the health and safety of Jackson residents and direct funding to Jackson immediately to fix this life and death issue," wrote the Chairs.
"This funding must be sustained to ensure that a safe and dependable drinking water system endures, especially in the face of climate change that will put even more stress on the city's water infrastructure."
On August 30, 2022, President Biden declared the Jackson water crisis a federal emergency after torrential rain in the Jackson area left residents without reliable access to safe drinking water for more than two weeks.
Scientists have concluded that the rise in coastal sea-levels and frequent flooding in Mississippiwhich contributed to the water crisis in Jacksonare a direct result of climate change. The city, the majority of whose residents are Black, has also suffered decades of disinvestment, and residents report they have not gone more than a month without a "boil water" notice in effect for over two years.
The American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made billions of dollars available to Mississippi to address a variety of problems, however, criteria used by the state to allocate federal funding may limit the funds Jackson receives compared to other locales, despite Jackson's much greater need. The Mississippi legislature's decision to allocate federal funding from the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program on a matching basis with municipalities risks further perpetuating underinvestment in Jackson. The cost of necessary maintenance to Jackson's water distribution systems is projected to be as high as $1 billion. Under the matching formula Mississippi adopted for American Rescue Plan funds, Jackson would directly receive, at most, around $84 million for water projects.
Jackson city officials informed Committee staff that the state has repeatedly sought to limit funding for Jackson to address its unsafe water systems, including the state's initial plan to bar communities of more than 4,000 people from competing for additional funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
In light of this information, the Chairs requested that the Governor provide the Committees with information related to the State of Mississippi's efforts to address the water crisis in Jackson and improve drinking water infrastructure, including the distribution of federal funds to localities, by October 31, 2022.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 -- Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued the following news release:
Today, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves requesting information on how the state plans to distribute more than $10 billion in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $429 million that was specifically allotted to enhance the state's water infrastructure.
"We urge you to take action to protect the health and safety of Jackson residents and direct funding to Jackson immediately to fix this life and death issue," wrote the Chairs.
"This funding must be sustained to ensure that a safe and dependable drinking water system endures, especially in the face of climate change that will put even more stress on the city's water infrastructure."
On August 30, 2022, President Biden declared the Jackson water crisis a federal emergency after torrential rain in the Jackson area left residents without reliable access to safe drinking water for more than two weeks.
Scientists have concluded that the rise in coastal sea-levels and frequent flooding in Mississippi-which contributed to the water crisis in Jackson-are a direct result of climate change. The city, the majority of whose residents are Black, has also suffered decades of disinvestment, and residents report they have not gone more than a month without a "boil water" notice in effect for over two years.
The American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made billions of dollars available to Mississippi to address a variety of problems, however, criteria used by the state to allocate federal funding may limit the funds Jackson receives compared to other locales, despite Jackson's much greater need. The Mississippi legislature's decision to allocate federal funding from the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program on a matching basis with municipalities risks further perpetuating underinvestment in Jackson. The cost of necessary maintenance to Jackson's water distribution systems is projected to be as high as $1 billion. Under the matching formula Mississippi adopted for American Rescue Plan funds, Jackson would directly receive, at most, around $84 million for water projects.
Jackson city officials informed Committee staff that the state has repeatedly sought to limit funding for Jackson to address its unsafe water systems, including the state's initial plan to bar communities of more than 4,000 people from competing for additional funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Water main break closes block of Morena Blvd.
SAN DIEGO
One side of a street in the Morena neighborhood was shut down early Sunday after a water main burst and was  closed most of the day, San Diego officials said.
The incident prompted authorities to shut down the southbound side of Morena Boulevard near the split with West Morena Boulevard, San Diego police said. Northbound traffic on Morena was not affected by the closure.
The water main break was reported shortly before 5 a.m. Sunday morning, according to Sgt. Brent Devore. A little after 6 a.m., the city crew working on the repair told police that the road closure would need to remain in place for about 18 hours.
Video from OnScene TV showed a large sinkhole in the traffic lanes.
City spokesperson Arian Collins said around midday that crews were working on the repairs, but could not provide an estimate for when the work would be completed. About 6:45 p.m., the city said on Twitter that the closure "may remain" in place "into Monday morning."
About 28 properties were affected, and will receive a precautionary boil water notice. The city sent two water wagons to the area for those left without water service, Collins said.

Crews with the city's public works and water utilities departments responded. They shut off the water and started to work on repairs.
No other details were immediately available.

Lastly, since Hurricane Ian made landfall, numerous Supervisors of Elections have publicly addressed their readiness, and thankfully most have very publicly stated that Ian's impacts will not interfere with their duties. This is a testament to the resiliency of Florida's elections system.

* At the request of the Supervisors of Elections in Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties, and at the recommendation of Secretary of State Cord Byrd, the Governor signed Executive Order 22-234, which will help ensure adequate access to Florida's 2022 General Election ballot for the voters of Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties.
* The Governor's Executive Order includes provisions authorizing the Supervisors of Elections in Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties to:
* Extend the number of days for early voting and designate additional early voting locations. The early voting period may begin as early as Monday, October 24, 2022, and can extend through Election Day, November 8, 2022.
* Allow voters in Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties to request by phone that their vote-by-mail (VBM) ballot be mailed to an address other than their address of record. Voters must still provide an appropriate form of identification in the same manner as absent uniform service and overseas voters.
* Designate and provide notice of the locations for secure ballot intake stations and relocate and consolidate polling locations as necessary.
* Increase the pool of eligible poll workers who may serve within Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties by making eligible any poll workers previously trained for the 2020 election cycle and thereafter and by encouraging state employees to serve as poll workers in these counties.
* Governor DeSantis also directed all state agencies to render aid and assistance as needed by the Supervisors of Elections in Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties. Secretary Byrd and the Department of State assessed the need for these provisions based on extensive outreach to Florida's Supervisors of Elections:
* Secretary Byrd and the Division of Elections leadership conducted continuous outreach and assessed the needs and readiness of counties in or around Hurricane Ian's path, including: Charlotte, Citrus, Collier, DeSoto, Dixie, Flagler, Gilchrist, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns, Taylor, and Volusia counties. Secretary Byrd also personally visited the hardest hit areas, including Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Lee, Hardee, and Sarasota counties to meet with their Supervisors of Elections in-person.
* Furthermore, Secretary Byrd participated in discussions with the Florida Supervisors of Elections (FSE). The FSE is a nonprofit association representing the Supervisors of Elections from all of Florida's 67 counties.
* Lastly, since Hurricane Ian made landfall, numerous Supervisors of Elections have publicly addressed their readiness, and thankfully most have very publicly stated that Ian's impacts will not interfere with their duties. This is a testament to the resiliency of Florida's elections system.
Office Closures
* DOH in Lee County is the only county still experiencing closures due to Hurricane Ian. An alternate location for services is being identified so in-person services can resume as quickly as possible. Some services are available at the Michigan Clinic, and remainder of clients are being served remotely or through other locations.
* State facilities closed can be found atdms.myflorida.com/buildingclosuresand the Florida DMS Emergency Information Hotline at 888-336-7345. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htlive.com

About the Indigenous Youth (K-12) Potable Water Innovation Challenge: The National Challenge is an open competition among youth designed to ignite a passion for science and innovation, community health, water-health and community service in young people, and business creation. This pilot initiative is predicated on principles of self-determination and self-government, developed and coordinated by RESEAU Centre for Mobilizing Innovation, the Challenge allows youth teams to engage elders and community leadership to identify local water challenges (e.g., watershed-specific issues in terms of natural and man-made stresses such as industrial or agricultural use and climate change), barriers to solving them and potential solutions. With mentorship from university researchers and water industry experts, the teams will develop a solution to solve a single challenge. Then, they workshop their idea with entrepreneurs before presenting their ideas to their community. Their work will be judged by their community and an Indigenous Advisory Council, who are also overseeing the program development, for opportunities for accelerator support to develop creative ideas into actual products and services to serve their community (and Indigenous communities at large).
About RESEAU Centre for Mobilizing Innovation: RESEAU is a nonprofit centre of excellence dedicated to the design and implementation of innovative solutions for drinking water quality and community health in Indigenous and rural communities. Through rigorous proprietary (multi-award-winning) problem-solving methodology, The Community Circle(TM), we ally with rural and Indigenous communities to develop innovative solutions for their water-health challenges and define success on their unique terms. In addition, we ensure all actionable insights are independent, objective, and tailored to the communities' goals and priorities, building grassroots trust and confidence in driving the product development cycle from concept to execution and beyond.

Congress investigates Mississippi's infrastructure spending after Jackson water crisis

House Democrats have launched an investigation into how Mississippi state leaders spent millions of dollars in federal funds allocated for infrastructure after last month's water crisis in Jackson.
Reps. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., sent a letter to Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves on Monday questioning how more than $10 billion in federal funding, specifically $429 million to enhance the state's water infrastructure, was allocated after the predominately Black capital city of Jackson suffered a water infrastructure collapse this summer that left thousands without running water.
"On Aug. 29, 2022, torrential rain in the Jackson area caused floodwater to seep into the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant, leading to the failure of the backup pumps upon which the plant relied," the letter, detailing the investigation by the Homeland Security and the Oversight and Reform committees, said. "The resulting system-wide loss of water pressure left Jackson residents without reliable access to safe drinking water for more than two weeks."
Mississippi lifted its boil notice in Jackson and surrounding areas after seven weeks on Sept. 15.
"It is possible, although I certainly pray not inevitable, that there will be further interruptions," Reeves said last month. "We cannot perfectly predict what may go wrong with such a broken system in the future."
Both Reeves and President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency to deliver bottled water to approximately 180,000 residents during last month's crisis after which Jackson's Mayor Chokwe Lumumba argued the city was in no position to handle the heavy rains and threats from climate change because state leaders had failed to provide financial support to fix the aging plant.
In Monday's letter, Maloney and Thompson also questioned why Jackson's water infrastructure failed while "a neighboring suburb's water service continued to flow."
"The city, the majority of whose residents are Black, has also suffered decades of disinvestment, and residents report they have not gone more than a month for over two years without a 'boil water' notice in effect," the letter said, adding that many of the pipes under Jackson have not been properly maintained since the 1950s. "Due to a steady exodus of white and affluent residents, the city has a reduced tax base to repair aging infrastructure."
On Friday, Reeves called for increased staffing at the treatment plant to ensure "clean water continues to be delivered to the people of Jackson." The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has requested the extension of an emergency procurement contract, scheduled to end on Nov. 29, for more staffing and maintenance at the treatment facility.
"MEMA is acting as the coordinating agency for the procurement of this contract. Staffing has been a critical issue at these facilities, and we are ready to move to the next phase of stabilizing Jackson's water services," Stephen McCraney, MEMA executive director, said in a statement. "Our top priority is life safety."

Reps. Maloney, Thompson Launch Formal Investigation into Miss. Governor Distribution of Federal Funds for Water System Repairs in Jackson

Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, issued the following news release:
Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves requesting information on how the state plans to distribute more than $10 billion in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $429 million that was specifically allotted to enhance the state's water infrastructure.
"We urge you to take action to protect the health and safety of Jackson residents and direct funding to Jackson immediately to fix this life and death issue," wrote the Chairs.
"This funding must be sustained to ensure that a safe and dependable drinking water system endures, especially in the face of climate change that will put even more stress on the city's water infrastructure."
On August 30, 2022, President Biden declared the Jackson water crisis a federal emergency after torrential rain in the Jackson area left residents without reliable access to safe drinking water for more than two weeks.
Scientists have concluded that the rise in coastal sea-levels and frequent flooding in Mississippi--which contributed to the water crisis in Jackson--are a direct result of climate change. The city, the majority of whose residents are Black, has also suffered decades of disinvestment, and residents report they have not gone more than a month without a "boil water" notice in effect for over two years.
The American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made billions of dollars available to Mississippi to address a variety of problems, however, criteria used by the state to allocate federal funding may limit the funds Jackson receives compared to other locales, despite Jackson's much greater need. The Mississippi legislature's decision to allocate federal funding from the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program on a matching basis with municipalities risks further perpetuating underinvestment in Jackson. The cost of necessary maintenance to Jackson's water distribution systems is projected to be as high as $1 billion. Under the matching formula Mississippi adopted for American Rescue Plan funds, Jackson would directly receive, at most, around $84 million for water projects.
Jackson city officials informed Committee staff that the state has repeatedly sought to limit funding for Jackson to address its unsafe water systems, including the state's initial plan to bar communities of more than 4,000 people from competing for additional funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
In light of this information, the Chairs requested that the Governor provide the Committees with information related to the State of Mississippi's efforts to address the water crisis in Jackson and improve drinking water infrastructure, including the distribution of federal funds to localities, by October 31, 2022.

Winning lottery ticket, stray cat feeding trial, booby-trapped political signs: News from around our 50 states

Alabama
Wetumpka: The trials for two women facing misdemeanor charges for feeding stray cats in the city have been delayed. The trials for Beverly Roberts, 85, and Mary Alston, 60, were set in Wetumpka Municipal Court for Thursday. The trials have been continued and a new date has not been set, said Terry Luck, one of the women’s defense attorneys. Luck and the women’s other attorney, retired Montgomery County Circuit Judge William Shashy, have scheduling conflicts, he said. The defense also asked city prosecutor Kenny James to recuse himself; he has a potential conflict of interest since he represented Roberts in a divorce case, Luck said. 
James has recused himself. Roberts faces charges of criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, and Alston faces charges of criminal trespassing and interfering with governmental operations, records show. In June both women were arrested on public property in downtown Wetumpka while they were attempting to feed and trap stray cats. Once the cats are trapped, the women pay to have them neutered and either work to get them adopted to return them to the stray colony. Officers arrived and arrested them, saying they had been previously trespassed and were told not to feed animals. Wetumpka Police Chief Greg Benton says the feeding of the animals created a nuisance because it attracts more cats to the area. Benton said both women were “repeatedly” warned not to feed the cats and could have prevented the arrests by heeding those warnings. Luck says the arrests are baseless and that the women were performing a service by working to neuter the animals and prevent the stay cat population from growing.
Alaska
Juneau: U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola reported raising $2.3 million in just over three weeks in September, leaving the Democrat with a large cash advantage over Republican rivals Sarah Palin and Nick Begich heading into the Nov. 8 election. Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka, a Republican challenger backed by former President Donald Trump, each raised just over $1 million from late July to Sept. 30, though Murkowski had about three times more cash available at the end of the period. The filings Saturday with the Federal Election Commission for the House race cover Sept. 6 through Sept. 30. Filings in the Senate race covered July 28 through Sept. 30. Peltola on Aug. 31 won a special election to fill Alaska’s House seat until January in a race that also included Palin and Begich. Next month’s election will decide who holds the seat for a two-year term, starting in January. Peltola, in the latest filings, reported having nearly $2.3 million available at the end of September. Palin, a former Alaska governor and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, reported bringing in about $230,000 during the latest period and having about $195,000 available. Begich reported raising about $57,500 and having just over $545,000 available. Begich loaned his campaign $650,000 earlier in the cycle.
Arizona
Sun City West: A father’s quick reaction kept a 12-year-old girl breathing after she was struck by lightning. Her father performed CPR three times after she was struck during Saturday’s storms in Sun City West. The girl, Ella, had stepped outside of her grandparent’s house to play with a friend when her father Steven Jorgensen heard loud thunder, saw a bright flash and saw her collapse. Jorgensen said he saw his daughter fall and immediately started performing CPR, which he learned while serving in the Marine Corps. “I got her heart back going, I got her breathing, and it was only for a short amount of time until I lost her again,” Jorgensen said. Jorgensen restarted CPR, got her heart to beat again and brought her inside the home while his parents were calling 911. While he was talking to the dispatcher, Ella’s heart stopped again. As Jorgensen started performing CPR for a third time, he said he was trying to remain calm and remembered a scene from the TV show “The Office” where they learn how to perform CPR. “You could hear me singing the Bee Gee’s ‘Staying Alive’ as I was giving her a resuscitation and then finally I got her going,” Jorgensen said. About three minutes later, emergency responders showed up and took over. Ella was taken to Banner Thunderbird Medical Center, and then she was flown to Valleywise Health Medical Center where she has been recovering “very well,” said Dr. Kevin Foster, Director of the Arizona Burn Center at Valleywise Health.
Arkansas
Van Buren: A man who had been booked into the Crawford County Jail on Friday died in custody Saturday, an attorney representing his family said. Jacob Allen Jones, 26, was booked at the jail by Van Buren police on a complaint of failure to appear on prior drug charges at 4:12 p.m. Friday, jail records show. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith said Jones died Saturday. He said Jones overdosed at the jail. He said Jones was in a cell for several hours without medical care. “I’m trying to get all of the information I can,” Powell said Sunday night. Efforts to reach Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante Sunday were unsuccessful. Jones’ body was taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Little Rock where the cause and the manner of death will be determined, the Crawford County Coroner’s office reported Monday. Powell said Jones suffered a medical episode at the jail. Other inmates stated they called for help from detention officers. Four detention officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, Powell said.
California
Sacramento: California’s coronavirus emergency will officially end in February, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday, nearly three years after the state’s first confirmed death from the disease prompted a raft of restrictions that upended public life. The decision will have little practical impact on most people’s lives, as most of the nearly 600 pandemic-related orders Newsom has issued since the start of the pandemic have already been lifted. And it won’t affect public health orders – including a pending statewide vaccine mandate for schoolchildren that could take effect next summer. But it does signal a symbolic end for some of the most restrictive elements of the pandemic, as it will dissolve Newsom’s authority to alter or change laws to make it easier for the government to quickly respond to the public health crisis. “The State of Emergency was an effective and necessary tool that we utilized to protect our state, and we wouldn’t have gotten to this point without it,” Newsom said in a news release, adding that the declaration will formally end on Feb. 28. Newsom declared a state of emergency for the coronavirus on March 4, 2020, shortly after an elderly patient was the first confirmed death from the disease in California. At the time, there were just 53 cases of COVID-19 in California, and state officials were holding a cruise ship off the coast so it could test passengers before allowing them to disembark in the state.
Colorado
Pueblo County: Nearly 110,000 voters in a southern Colorado county will be receiving general election ballots that were mistakenly labeled as primary election ballots, a blunder that has led the state’s secretary of state to appoint a supervisor to oversee November’s vote in a county that also had issues with ballots in its primary election. The misprint on ballots that are being sent out to voters in Pueblo County was on a tear-off tab and does not effect the “legal validity” or accuracy of the rest of the ballot, Secretary of State Jena Griswold’s office said in a news release Monday. For that reason and because of the short time frame before the ballots were mailed, they will not be reprinted. It is the second time this year that the county has had problems with ballots.
Connecticut
Waterbury: A commuter train struck a tractor trailer in Connecticut on Monday, authorities said. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said a Metro-North train headed to Bridgeport hit a tractor trailer at a railroad crossing in Waterbury shortly before 11 a.m. The MTA did not provide any information about injuries, but Lt. Ryan Bessette of the Waturbury police said the tractor driver and at least two train passengers were treated for injuries that appeared to be minor. Train service in the area was halted while police and the MTA investigated the crash.
Delaware
Dover: A 29-year-old man who was fatally shot early Sunday in Dover has been identified by police. Jesse Holley marks the city’s first homicide this year. Police were dispatched to the 100 block of S. Bradford St. just after 1:10 a.m. Sunday after receiving a call for a shooting. Arriving officers found Holley there. Dover Police Master Cpl. Ryan Schmid said Holley had a gunshot wound to his lower body. Holley was taken to an area hospital, where he died. This is Dover’s first homicide since June 30, 2021, when 19-year-old Tysean Nelson was one of four people shot in the capital city’s 100 block of S. New St. So far this year, 14 people have been shot in Dover – one fatally. Last year at the same time, 36 people had been shot in Dover – three of them fatally. Holley’s fatal shooting investigation is ongoing and anyone with information should contact the Dover police.
District of Columbia
Washington: Authorities said a maintenance worker brought a registered gun into a high school, WUSA-TV reports. The worker showed up to Anacostia High School with the gun in his bag after the school requested a worker for repairs, and the man was arrested. Police didn’t say if the gun was loaded, according to the news outlet. Having a firearm on school property is not allowed at any D.C. Public Schools campus. No injuries were reported. “Please be assured that no one was harmed, and the incident was promptly handled according to our security procedures,” DCPS Press Secretary Deborah Isaac said. “All students and staff remained safe and supervised during this incident.”
Florida
Fort Myers: A winning lottery ticket worth a share of a $494 million Mega Millions jackpot was purchased in a city hammered by Hurricane Ian late last month. State lottery officials on Monday said one of the two winning tickets was purchased at a 7-Eleven in Fort Myers. The other winning ticket was bought in California. Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 28 and has been blamed for more than 100 fatalities in the state. It was the third-deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland this century. More than half of the storm-related deaths in Florida were reported in Lee County, which includes Fort Myers. Lottery winners in the state have 180 days to claim their prize. Under a new state law, lottery winners can remain anonymous for 90 days from the day they claim the winnings, if their prize is worth $250,000 or more. Past winners have also set up legal trusts as a way to keep their identities anonymous.
Georgia
Town: A college student died after being struck by the propeller of a small plane as he disembarked at an airport in southeast Georgia, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Board are investigating the death Sunday night at Statesboro-Bulloch County Airport, FAA spokesman Steve Kulm said. Sani Aliyu, of Atlanta, and a young woman had flown on the single-engine Cessna to nearby Savannah and back on a date, Bulloch County Coroner Jake Futch told the Statesboro Herald. He said the plane landed safely on the return trip to Statesboro. The woman “got off the plane and walked toward the back of the plane,” Futch said, “and he got off the airplane and walked toward the front of the plane, and when he did, the propeller hit him.” Aliyu was a sophomore enrolled at Georgia Southern University, school spokeswoman Melanie Simon said. A pilot and co-pilot had flown the couple, said Capt. Todd Hutchens of the Bulloch County Sheriff’s Office. He said deputies were sharing information they gathered with the FAA and NTSB. “Nobody is really at fault or anything,” Hutchens said. “It was an accident.”
Hawaii
Honolulu: A former building plans examiner pleaded guilty Monday to all charges in an indictment accusing him of participating in a scheme to take bribes in exchange for expediting projects. Wayne Inouye pleaded guilty to six counts of honest services wire fraud and one count of making a false statement. He did not have an agreement with U.S. prosecutors about what sentence they will seek. Prosecutors say Inouye took at least $89,000 in bribes from an architect and several thousand dollars from others to approve and expedite their projects ahead of others. Inouye lied to an FBI agent and federal prosecutor when he told them an architect loaned him $100,000, Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Nolan said. When asked by the judge at Monday’s hearing to describe what he did, Inouye didn’t use the words bribe or bribery. He said an architect offered to compensate him to review plans before submitting them so that he could ensure they were code-compliant. “These plans would have been approved anyway,” he said, but added that they were expedited. He also said he received compensation from a signage contractor to help them submit their application to the department. He said he made a misleading statement to an FBI agent and a federal prosecutor when he told them the compensation was a loan. Honest services wire fraud carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, while the false statement charge has a maximum sentences of up to five years.
Idaho
Boise: State revenue from tax collections was $50 million below expectations for the first three months of the current fiscal year, but the state still has a $1.5 billion budget surplus, officials said Monday. The Legislative Services Office said September’s revenue was down about $11 million, with sales and corporate income taxes below predictions. That follows similar misses by small amounts on projections for July and August. Despite the $50 million drop, about 3.6%, in projected revenue for the first three months of this fiscal year, the state is still seeing revenue growth and bringing in more money compared to the same period last year – about $94 million more, or 7.5%. The Division of Financial Management also released a report earlier this month providing a snapshot of the state’s finances. Both reports include a $500 million income tax rebate this year approved by lawmakers in a special session in September, as well as an ongoing income and corporate tax cut that takes effect Jan. 1. The ongoing cut comes from creating a 5.8% flat tax that is expected to cut more than $100 million from revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Those tax cuts came out of a budget surplus then estimated at about $2 billion.
Illinois
Sycamore: A mountain lion that was struck and killed last weekend along a highway will be analyzed by biologists seeking to uncover the rare animal’s origins, state wildlife officials said. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources said Monday the mountain lion died Sunday after being hit by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County. Illinois State Police recovered the carcass, which will undergo a necropsy and DNA analysis at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana. The DNR said that analysis will provide insight “about the animal, its place of origin, and exploratory movements across the Midwest.” DNR experts believe the mountain lion may be the same one recorded in late September by a trail camera on private property in northwestern Illinois’ Whiteside County, which abuts Iowa. Mountain lions were eliminated from Illinois prior to the 1870s due to habitat loss and hunting. They have been a protected species in Illinois since 2015.
Indiana
Indianapolis: Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch tested positive for COVID-19 after experiencing cold-like symptoms on Monday, according to her office. Crouch said in a Twitter post that she had “mild symptoms and will continue to work for Hoosiers from home while following all of Indiana’s COVID guidelines.” Crouch was at her home in Evansville after testing positive with the COVID-19 virus for the first time, said her office spokesman, Ron Green. Crouch, 70, received two initial doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 and has since gotten a booster shot, Green said. Crouch has been lieutenant governor since 2017 as Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s running mate in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. She previously was state auditor for three years after serving nine years as a state legislator from Evansville.
Iowa
Cedar Rapids: U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson was released Tuesday morning from a Cedar Rapids hospital where she was being treated for a kidney infection, her office said. Hinson spent two nights in UnityPoint St. Luke’s Hospital after being admitted Sunday evening, according to her office. “I am feeling much better, will continue resting at home, and look forward to getting out on the road to be with Iowans soon,” Hinson said in a statement Tuesday morning. A debate scheduled for Tuesday night between Hinson, a Republican, and her Democratic challenger, Liz Mathis, was canceled in light of Hinson’s medical emergency. Iowa PBS, which was hosting the debate, said there are no plans to reschedule the debate.
Kansas
Fairway: The grounds of a former Native American boarding school will be searched to determine if any Indigenous children were buried there, state officials said. The Kansas Historical Society, which owns the site in Fairway, is contracting with the University of Kansas Center for Research to conduct a ground-penetrating radar survey of the 12 acres to search for unmarked graves, The Kansas City Star reported. The current Shawnee Indian Mission historical site was one of hundreds of schools run by the government and religious groups in the 1800s and 1900s. Thousands of Native American children were forcibly taken from their homes and placed in such schools, with a goal of assimilating them into white American culture and Christianity. Leaders of the Shawnee Tribe and other tribes had requested a search of the Fairway site. But tribal officials said in a statement that they were not consulted about the Historical Society’s project proposal before it was announced. “We have requested formal consultation to address serious concerns about the motives of this project, potential deficiencies in the process that may render incomplete findings, and what plans may be for utilizing any results from the project,” the tribe said. Patrick Zollner, executive director of the historical society, responded that the Shawnee Tribe was the “first to know” about the project proposal. He said the society also contacted other tribes, including the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, Kaw Nation, Osage Nation and others. Zollner and Erinn Barcomb-Peterson, a spokeswoman with the University of Kansas, emphasized that consultation with the tribes is ongoing and that work will not proceed until that process is completed.
Kentucky
Frankfort: Education in Kentucky faces its own difficult recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a grim fact revealed Tuesday by statewide test scores showing that many students from elementary to high school struggled across a span of core subjects. Fewer than half of students tested statewide were reading at grade level, with even lower across-the-board scores posted in math, science and social studies. Education Commissioner Jason Glass acknowledged there’s “no quick fix” to overcome challenges caused by the pandemic, when schools shifted to virtual learning and staff shortages were common. The recovery in education will take “time and resources,” he stressed. “As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our students and our schools as they continue to recover from the interrupted learning that occurred over the past two years,” Glass said in a news release. “These assessment results will serve as the baseline from which we will move forward as we look to new and innovative learning opportunities for all of Kentucky’s students.” Kentucky has received more than $2 billion in federal funding through the Democratic-backed American Rescue Plan passed by Congress last year. The funding aims to help accelerate learning and provide additional support to districts and the students who need it the most. Kentucky’s results are consistent with what many other states are experiencing, Glass said.
Louisiana
Baton Rouge: A shipwreck has emerged along the banks of the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge as water levels plummet – threatening to reach record lows in some areas. The ship, which archaeologists believe to be a ferry that sunk in the late 1800s to early 1900s, was spotted by a Baton Rouge resident walking along the shore earlier this month. The discovery is the latest to surface from ebbing waters caused by drought. During the summer, receding waters in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area revealed several skeletal remains, countless desiccated fish, a graveyard of forgotten boats and even a sunken World War II-era craft that once surveyed the lake. “Eventually the river will come back up and (the ship) will go back underwater,” said Chip McGimsey, the Louisiana state archeologist, who has been surveying the wreck during the past two weeks. “That’s part of the reason for making the big effort to document it this time – cause she may not be there the next time.” McGimsey believes that the ship may be the Brookhill Ferry, which likely carried people and horse-drawn wagons from one-side of the river to the other – before major bridges spanned the mighty Mississippi. Newspaper archives indicate that the ship sank in 1915 during a major storm. But this is not the first time the low water levels have revealed the ship. McGimsey said that tiny parts of the vessel were exposed in 1990s.
Maine
Bangor: A police officer was justified in shooting a man in Bangor, despite a review of evidence that showed the officer was farther away from the man than previously thought, the state’s attorney general said. Attorney General Aaron Frey conducted a second review of the shooting of Brian Barker, who was shot three times and survived in 2018. Frey said Friday that his office determined that the officer was more than 37 feet away from Barker and not about 15 feet as it initially stated. Frey said Barker’s movements leading up to the shooting still represented enough of a threat to justify the use of deadly force, the Bangor Daily News reported. Bangor police officers were checking on Barker and saw that he had a knife, which they repeatedly asked him to put down. Frey said Barker’s movements before the shooting made it unclear if he was going to attempt to attack one of the officers on the scene, the Daily News reported. The 21-foot distance marker between officers and a suspect is sometimes referred to as “kill zone” because officers are taught that at that distance an armed person can quickly close the distance.
Maryland
Annapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced an investment of $77 million on Monday for realignment and upgrades to the state’s section of U.S. 219 in Garrett County. Hogan said Monday that the plan advances his pledge to address Maryland’s portion of the U.S. 219 corridor between Interstate 68 and Meyerdale, Pennsylvania, to improve safety, expand economic opportunity, and reinforce the regional supply chain. Hogan also officially dedicated the portion of U.S. 219 in Maryland to retiring state Sen. George Edwards. He cited the senator’s support for improvements that benefit the region. The latest improvements to Maryland’s portion of U.S. 219 will renovate and expand the 1-mile segment between Old Salisbury Road and the Pennsylvania state line. In 2021, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration completed the first phase, which included nearly $65 million of upgrades along U.S. 219 between I-68 and Old Salisbury Road. Finishing the second phase has been identified as Garrett County’s top transportation priority.
Massachusetts
Plympton: Striking truckers used tractor-trailers to block the exits at New England’s largest wholesale food distributor Monday and prevented some employees from leaving, resulting in as many as 20 arrests, police said. More than 400 Teamster union members arrived at the Sysco facility in Plympton, Massachusetts, in the early morning and stopped about 100 employees from leaving, Police Chief Matthew Ahl said in a statement. Police spent two hours negotiating with picketers. “After the attempted negotiation to move union members out of the roadway to create a safe passable environment, unfortunately we had to respond by removing members of the crowd who were inciting a hostile picket line,” the chief said. Sixteen to 20 people were arrested on charges including disorderly conduct and assault and battery, he said. After the arrests, traffic started to flow safely. About 300 Sysco drivers represented by the Teamsters Local 653 started their strike Oct. 1 seeking better pay and benefits. Voicemails seeking comment were left with union representatives.
Michigan
Sturgis: The U.S. Supreme Court has said it would hear arguments brought by a deaf Michigan man who wants to sue his former school district for failing to provide him a suitable teacher who knew sign language for more than a decade and inflating his grades when he could neither read nor write. Miguel Perez, an immigrant who moved to the U.S. with his family as a child and is now in his 20s, has been trying for years to press a claim for compensatory damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) against the Sturgis Public School District in southwest Michigan. But lower courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati, have rejected that claim, saying Perez never exhausted the administrative review required first under another federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). No date has been set for oral arguments before the Supreme Court.
Minnesota
St. Paul: Enbridge Energy, the owner and operator of the Line 3 pipeline project in northern Minnesota, will pay more than $11 million after investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the pipeline’s construction, state regulators said Monday. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Department of Natural Resources announced the results from investigations of water quality violations and aquifer breaches related to the construction project. Combined with the previous DNR actions, and in partnership with Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the investigations have resulted in more than $11 million in payments, environmental projects, and financial assurances from Enbridge, according to the state agencies. The Minnesota agency investigation found that Enbridge violated regulations when it discharged construction storm water into wetlands and inadvertently releasing drilling mud into surface water at 12 locations in June and August of 2021. The DNR also finalized agreements with Enbridge to address three aquifer breaches related to Line 3 construction.
Mississippi
Jackson: Congress is investigating the crisis that left 150,000 people in the capital city without running water for several days in late summer, according to a letter sent to Gov. Tate Reeves by two Democratic officials. Reps. Bennie Thompson, of Mississippi, and Carolyn Maloney, of New York, sent the letter Monday requesting information on how Mississippi plans to spend $10 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act and from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and $429 million “specifically allotted to enhance the state’s water infrastructure.” The letter indicates “the start of a joint investigation” by the House Homeland Security and the Oversight and Reform committees into a crisis that deprived Jackson’s 150,000 residents of running water for several days in late August and early September, Adam Comis, a staffer for the committee, told The Associated Press. Thompson’s district includes most of Jackson, and he chairs the Homeland Security Committee. Maloney chairs the Oversight and Reform Committee. Jackson has had water problems for years, and the latest troubles began in late August after heavy rainfall exacerbated problems in the city’s main treatment plant, leaving many customers without running water. Jackson had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. Running water was restored within days, and a boil-water notice was lifted in mid-September, but the letter to Reeves says “water plant infrastructure in the city remains precarious, and risks to Jackson’s residents persist.”
Missouri
Springfield: Libraries receiving state funds would be required to determine what material is “age-appropriate” and restrict minors from accessing some books under a proposed rule submitted by the secretary of state Monday. The proposed rule, submitted by Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, would also allow parents to challenge a library’s “age-appropriate” designation, and ban state funds from being used to “purchase or acquire materials in any form that appeal to the prurient interest of any minor.” Libraries that receive state funds could see them cut off if they violate the proposed rule. “When state dollars are involved, we want to bring back local control and parental involvement in determining what children are exposed to,” Ashcroft, a Republican, said in a statement. “Foremost, we want to protect our children.” After the rule is formally published in the state register on Nov. 15, residents will be able to submit public comment on it for 30 days. Ashcroft cited state laws that gives his office authority for rulemaking over library funds when he filed the rule. Under the rule, libraries will have to adopt a “written, publicly-accessible” policy determining “how selections are made in considering the appropriateness for the age and maturity level of any minor ... who accesses any material in any form.” That policy will also allow parents and guardians to know what materials are available, and bans library employees from allowing minors to access those materials without a parent or guardian’s permission.
Montana
Helena: A federal administrative law judge has denied a request to block permits that expand bison grazing in north-central Montana while several parties challenge them. Gov. Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Austin Knudsen and the Montana Stockgrowers Association asked the U.S. Interior Department’s hearing division in August to reverse the the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s granting of the permits. Administrative Law Judge Veronica Larvie ruled on Oct. 13 that while there were several concerns about the permits, the parties failed to show that the expanded bison grazing would cause immediate and irreparable harm and she declined to block them while the case moves forward. The Stockgrowers argue additional bison grazing will harm the cattle industry and the local economy. The conservation group American Prairie sought the 10-year permits to remove some fences so bison could roam more freely in Phillips County south of Malta. The grazing area in dispute covers about 108 square miles. It will allow American Prairie to increase the size of its bison herd from about 800 animals to 1,000 bison by 2025, the group said.
Nebraska
Grand Island: The body of a Texas woman found in the trunk of a car that crashed in south-central Nebraska during a police chase was the mother of the teenage driver, police have confirmed. The crash happened Friday along Interstate 80 near Grand Island, shortly after authorities were alerted to be on the lookout for a vehicle out of Texas believed to be involved in a possible homicide there, the Nebraska State Patrol said. A trooper spotted the car minutes later and attempted to stop it, but the driver refused to pull over and a chase ensued reaching speeds of more than 110 mph, the patrol said. The car soon crashed, and the 17-year-old driver suffered serious but non-lethal injuries, police said. Police also found the body of a woman in the car’s trunk. The following day, the patrol identified the woman as 49-year-old Michelle Roenz, of Harris County, Texas. The Harris County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Monday she is the mother of the 17-year-old boy who was driving the car. No charges against the teen appeared Monday in Nebraska online court records.
Nevada
Reno: A 47-year-old man will spend up to 15 years in prison for sending death threats to a half-dozen Nevada elected officials in messages citing false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen. Matthew Carter was found guilty in September of three felony counts of aggravated talking and one count of misdemeanor harassment. Washoe County District Judge Egan Walker sentenced him last week to two to five years for each felony, to be served consecutively. Walker also sentenced Carter to six months for the misdemeanor but said it can be served concurrently, meaning at the same time as the other sentences. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said Monday that Carter sent multiple racist and threatening messages to U.S. Attorney Jason Frierson, state Treasurer Zach Conine, three members of the Nevada Assembly and Gov. Steve Sisolak’s chief of staff Yvanna Cancela. Frierson previously served as speaker of the Assembly and Cancela previously served as a state senator. The others targeted were Assembly members Steve Yeager, Lesley Cohen and Brittney Miller. Ford said the threats, which included racial slurs and references toward lynching, cited passage of expanded mail-in voting ahead of the election as a reason for his promised violence toward the officials.
New Hampshire
Atkinson: A laboratory equipment distributor has been fined $140,000 on 14 felony counts of failing to file export information on shipments to Russia and Ukraine between 2015 and 2019. Intertech Trading Corporation, in Atkinson, pleaded guilty to falsely describing the nature and value of the exported items on commercial invoices and shipping forms, the U.S. attorney’s office in New Hampshire said. In its plea agreement filed in July, Intertech said that it used false descriptions such as “lamp for aquarium” or “spares for welding system,” rather than accurately identifying the sophisticated scientific equipment actually contained in the shipments. Intertech, which was sentenced in federal court Monday, admitted that it drastically undervalued the shipments, thereby evading the requirement to file Electronic Export Information, which would have been reported to the departments of Commerce and Homeland Security, the U.S. attorney’s office said. The company’s actions jeopardized national security, said Joseph Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the FBI Boston Division. Intertech “had an unblemished record in the industry for more than 30 years and has been devastated financially” by the government’s investigation and the resulting plea agreement, its attorney said in a court document.
New Jersey
Trenton: The state Supreme Court got two new members Monday. The Democrat-led state Senate confirmed Rachel Wainer Apter and Douglas Fasciale to fill two of three vacancies on the state’s highest court. Wainer Apter is currently the head of the civil rights division within the state attorney general’s office and previously served as counsel to the attorney general. Fasciale has been serving a temporary assignment on the high court since mandatory retirements left openings. He served as a judge on the Appellate Division since 2010 and was a state Superior Court judge from 2004 to 2010. Murphy appointed Wainer Apter, a Democrat, in 2021, but her nomination was held up as state senators vetted her appointment. Murphy appointed Fasciale, a Republican, last month. Their appointments track with a New Jersey tradition of governors appointing no more than four members from their own party. “This prevents the Court from lurching too far in one direction or the other. It forces Governors to select nominees from among the best lawyers and judges in the state, regardless of party,” Murphy said when he appointed Fasciale. The seven-member court still has one more vacancy, which Murphy must fill and the Senate confirm.
New Mexico
Albuquerque: The New Mexico Civil Guard has been barred from publicly acting as a military unit without authorization or assuming the role of law enforcement by using organized force at public protests or gathering, according to a newspaper. The Albuquerque Journal reported Tuesday that District Court Judge Elaine Lujan also has banned such activity by the group’s directors, officers, agents, employees, members and any of their successor organizations and members. Lujan granting a motion by Bernalillo County District Attorney Raúl Torrez, who told the Journal that the decision, “fundamentally represents a victory for the rule of law….We’re trying to prevent violent extremism.”A lawsuit alleged members of the New Mexico Civil Guard violated state law by exercising or attempting to exercise the functions of a peace officer without authority and have organized and operated as a military unit without having been called to military service by the governor, according to the Journal. The newspaper said the governor has exclusive authority under the state Constitution to call on the militia to keep the public peace.
New York
New York City: Thieves stole 20 cars from a dealership and will likely use the vechicles to commit other crimes, a top police official said. The car thieves hit a Mistubishi dealership over the weekend, broke open a lock box that held keys and drove off with late-model cars, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said Monday. While some stolen cars are sold overseas, Essig said investigators believe the cars stolen from the Mitsubishi lot will be used to carry out other crimes. “Our feeling is just based on the way crime is going, people taking these cars, they will use these 20 cars in multiple robberies and burglaries throughout the city, switching plates on and off and on and off,” Essig told reporters. Employees did not realize the cars were gone until they came in Monday morning, the chief said. One of the stolen cars was recovered in Brooklyn, he said.
North Carolina
Raleigh: With abortions in the state and the number of out-of-state clinic patients soaring after Roe v. Wade was struck down, judges should permit more trained health professionals to prescribe pills for medication-induced abortions, plaintiffs in a lawsuit wrote on Monday. Abortion providers, medical workers and an abortion-rights group awaiting trial next year in their 2020 lawsuit challenging many state abortion rules asked a three-judge panel to act now and block a law limiting who can provide such medication from just certain licensed physicians. Allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who work at certified abortion clinics to prescribe these pills would immediately expand access to abortion in North Carolina, the plaintiffs said. These “advanced practice clinicians” already can prescribe the same two medicines used in medication-induced abortions for managing a patient’s miscarriage, according to a memo describing the legal grounds for a preliminary injunction. The court should remove “an unnecessary barrier to care so that more North Carolinians can access a full range of reproductive health services, including time-sensitive abortion care, in their own state,” Anne Logan Bass, a nurse practitioner at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, and a plaintiff, said in a news release. North Carolina abortion clinic operators have said they’ve seen a marked increase in the number of women coming from other states that now have more severe abortion limitations following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June.
North Dakota
Almont: A UPS driver came to the rescue of two people who crashed their vehicle in a rural area of Morton County, the Bismarck Tribune reports. According to the shipping company, Ken Oakes was making deliveries Sept. 20 when he came upon a crashed car on a bridge east of Almont. Oakes, an Army veteran with medical training, helped a female passenger and a male passenger out of the vehicle and continued to help when paramedics arrived, according to the news outlet. “He was amazingly helpful,” said Frank Melchior, an emergency medical technician with the Almont Ambulance Service.
Ohio
Columbus: Patrol Superintendent Charles Jones announced Friday that the Ohio State Highway Patrol would permit troopers to have tattoos on their arms but they’ll have to wear long-sleeve uniforms − even in the heat of summer − to cover the ink. The patrol’s policy still prohibits tattoos above the neckline or below the wrist. Exceptions may be allowed for “a conservative wedding band/civil union tattoo, brand or body art” on the ring finger, the policy states. Police departments across the state and the nation are relaxing their grooming rules in an effort to recruit employees. Columbus, Akron and Cleveland police departments recently announced new policies. Patrol Academy Commandant Major John Altman, who declined to disclose whether he has tattoos, said the new tattoo policy means the patrol can reach out to several hundred potential recruits who expressed interest but also said they have visible tattoos. Altman noted that there are no current plans to change the patrol’s policy that prohibits facial hair.
Oklahoma
Pauls Valley: A politically connected attorney who served as Gov. Kevin Stitt’s hospital surge plan adviser during the pandemic was accused Monday in a drug trafficking charge of illegal involvement in marijuana businesses. Matt Stacy, 43, became the latest attorney to be accused of helping out-of-state clients establish marijuana grow operations by finding them “ghost” owners in Oklahoma. Stitt on Monday said he will be donating Stacy’s contribution to his reelection campaign to charity. Stacy, a lieutenant colonel in the Oklahoma Army National Guard, donated $2,900 to Stitt last year. Stacy was charged Monday in Garvin County District Court with 13 felony counts after being indicted last month by the state’s multicounty grand jury. Stacy “has acted as a consigliere to international drug trafficking organizations engaged in industrial-scale black-market marijuana manufacturing and trafficking,” a state narcotics investigator alleged in an affidavit filed with the charge. The illegal conduct included “structuring fraudulent ‘straw’ ownership schemes to circumvent Oklahoma ownership disclosure and structure requirements for medical marijuana businesses,” the agent with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control alleged. State law requires a licensed grow operation to be at least 75% owned by Oklahoma residents. “On multiple occasions, Stacy created and/or facilitated the creation of business entities through the use or recruitment of Oklahoma residents to operate as ‘straw owners’ to facially satisfy the Oklahoma residency requirements.” the agent alleged. One grower reported paying Stacy $60,000, according to the affidavit.
Oregon
Portland: Two people have together been awarded $10.4 million at trial after a jury found they suffered hearing loss and emotional trauma when they narrowly escaped a natural gas explosion in Portland. Lawyers for gas leak investigator Eric Rader and stylist Kristen Prentice said both suffered life-altering changes, including post-traumatic stress disorder, after an excavator hit a buried gas pipeline Oct. 19, 2016. Rader had found high levels of gas inside a corner bagel shop and warned firefighters to flee shortly before the blast obliterated the three-story commercial building and gutted a neighboring structure. “The reading on his gas meter indicated extreme risk,” said Greg Kafoury, the attorney for Rader and Prentice. “Rader notified nearby first responders, saving many.” Prentice was about to enter the salon next door when firefighters alerted her to the danger. Both took shelter nearby. Rader and Prentice are now permanently afflicted with hearing loss and painful sensitivity to loud noises, Kafoury said. Their lawsuits were tried jointly in Multnomah County Circuit Court. On Thursday, a jury awarded $6.5 million to Prentice and $3.9 million to Rader – the largest payout to date over the blast. Jurors found contractor Loy Clark Pipeline Co. liable for both of the workers’ medical expenses and lost earnings. Each award included $2.3 million in punitive damages, though about 70% of that money will be directed to a state crime victims fund under Oregon law.
Pennsylvania
Newtown: Political signs in southeastern Pennsylvania have been found booby-trapped with razor blades, which resulted in sliced fingers for one resident, police said. Upper Makefield Township police said Sunday that a campaign sign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro was placed without permission on someone’s property, and while trying to remove it the resident found that razor blades had been “placed around the perimeter of the sign.” “Obviously, this was designed to inflict punishment on anyone who attempted to remove the sign,” police said in a social media post. Police said they inspected all campaign signs and found razor blades placed around the perimeter of signs for two other Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Ashley Ehasz. Fetterman is running for U.S. Senate and Ehasz for U.S. House. Police said their investigation continues and warned residents to exercise caution in removing signs placed on their property without permission, and to call them if “any implements” have been installed on the signs.
Rhode Island
Providence: A lawsuit brought by Rhode Island’s cities and towns against consulting giant McKinsey & Company over its alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis through deceptive marketing practices will be heard in federal court in Northern California. Towns across the state joined their brethren in Pennsylvania, Utah, Wisconsin and elsewhere in accusing McKinsey of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy by advising Purdue Pharma how to downplay the dangers of Oxycontin while maximizing sales of the prescription painkiller. The communities charge that McKinsey’s misconduct has perpetuated a serious public-health crisis that brought about significant economic damages, including spiking costs related to public health, opioid-related crimes, emergencies and public-safety challenges.
South Carolina
Anderson: Eight Starbucks employees, three of whom were fired by the company, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Starbucks and a former manager, Melissa Morris, who accused the employees of kidnapping and assault prior to the start of a shift in early August. A summons for the lawsuit was filed on Oct. 17 after the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office found that Morris’ criminal accusation was false, according to the summons. On Aug. 1, eight employees at a Starbucks in Anderson surrounded a store manager and presented a list of demands that included better pay, equipment upgrades and better staffing, according to Mya Ourada, a store barista at the time. On Aug. 3, Morris, the Starbucks store manager, in coordination with Starbucks management reported to police that the workers had assaulted and kidnapped the manager on Aug. 1, according to the summons. According to the summons, the Sheriff’s Office told a reporter, “None of the allegations were true... The employees did not stop her from leaving and did not put their hands on her, which is what the boss reported had happened.” “Starbucks knew exactly what they were doing when it smeared our reputation, painting us as criminals,” Aneil Tripathi, a former employee who was fired, said in a press release. “They abused the law enforcement process to intimidate us and keep us terrified that a knock on the door would be the Anderson police coming to take us away.” Starbucks and Morris have 30 days to answer the claims in the summons. “We are reviewing the details of this matter and look forward to defending the company against the allegations made,” a Starbucks spokesperson wrote in an email to the Independent Mail. “No Starbucks partner has been or will be disciplined for supporting or engaging in lawful union activity – but interests in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners.”
South Dakota
Sioux Falls: The City Council passed a group of ordinances and resolutions Tuesday, approving a TIF district that a local developer hopes will aid in creating an affordable housing development in eastern Sioux Falls. The $2.14 million TIF agreement passed the council 7-1 at their meeting, alongside resolutions that formally set the boundaries of the district, as well as approving the project plan for the development.Developer Kelly Nielson told councilors last month he’d been trying to work on a project like this for years, and that his staff had recently “started designing the least expensive house we could come up with.” Each of the 65 homes in the 9.7-acre development must be priced at or below $340,000, with two-bedroom, one-bathroom houses set at a price goal of $232,000 or below, and two-bedroom, two-bathroom units in a twin home with an unfinished basement set at a price goal of $323,000 or below. All of the homes would all need to be constructed by May 1, 2028, Business Development Coordinator Dustin Powers told councilors at the meeting.
Tennessee
Brentwood: A small plane crashed Tuesday on a road in a Nashville suburb, killing one person, authorities said. The pilot was the only person on board the single-engine plane that crashed in Brentwood at 7:30 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. Brentwood police confirmed one fatality but didn’t immediately indicate whether the person who died was on the plane. Police said on Twitter that the two-lane road in the community just south of Nashville was closed afterward. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.
Texas
Houston: A man was convicted of capital murder on Monday in the 2019 shooting death of a law enforcement officer who was the first Sikh deputy in his agency. A jury took less than 30 minutes before finding Robert Solis, 50, guilty in the killing of Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal during a September 2019 traffic stop in a residential cul-de-sac 18 miles northwest of Houston. Authorities say the 42-year-old deputy was shot multiple times from behind after he stopped Solis and was walking back to his patrol car. The same jury in Houston that convicted Solis began hearing evidence late Monday afternoon in the trial’s punishment phase. Prosecutors are seeking a death sentence. Just before his trial began last week, Solis fired his court appointed attorneys and chose to represent himself. Solis testified in his own defense and told jurors he had accidentally shot Dhaliwal. Prosecutors argued Solis deliberately shot Dhaliwal because he didn’t want to go back to jail. At the time of the traffic stop, Solis had a warrant for violating parole. Dhaliwal was described by Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez as “a trailblazer” because he was the first Sikh deputy with the sheriff’s office when he joined the force around 2009. Gonzalez’s predecessor as sheriff, Adrian Garcia, implemented a religious accommodation policy that allowed Dhaliwal to wear the traditional turban and beard of the Sikh religion.
Utah
Orem: U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah worked to distinguish himself from former President Donald Trump in a contentious debate Monday evening. “I stood against my party time and time again to oppose reckless spending. I will do it again and again and again. We need people who say no,” the second-term Republican said. Lee repeatedly pointed to his voting record and twice told the audience at Utah Valley University that he voted less in line with Trump than all but two Republican senators – Rand Paul and Susan Collins. “To suggest that I’m beholden to either party, that I’ve been a bootlicker for either party is folly. And it’s contradicted by the plain facts,” Lee said. Lee faces a challenge from Evan McMullin, a former Republican known most for his long-shot bid for president six years ago, when as an independent he won 21.5% of voters in Utah, including Lee. McMullin has remained a pillar of the anti-Trump movement, attacking the former president as an authoritarian who poses a threat to democracy. Lee’s last minute efforts to put space between his voting record and Trump’s stances depart from his past messaging as Election Day nears.
Vermont
Brattleboro: A plan is being developed to turn part of the Winston Prouty Center for Child Family Development campus into as many as 300 housing units, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. “We’re pushing forward with it,” said Chloe Learey, executive director at the center. “Master planning is really that process of going through what are all the things we would want and what fits and what’s on the landscape and where are the wetlands and how much is it going to cost?” They hope to complete the plan in April, according to the news outlet. The design is intended “to build a neighborhood essentially,” Learey said. The planning process is estimated to cost $200,000. Grants and donations are being sought to assist with the project, the news outlet reports.
Virginia
Woodbridge: A couple, their 19-year-old daughter and a 36-year-old man were found dead in their home after a fellow resident, who is now charged with murder, called 911 to report a shooting, police said Tuesday. Prince William County Police officers responded to a Woodbridge home on Monday afternoon after a 911 caller reported that someone shot into the residence and people might be dead inside, Police Chief Peter Newsham said at a news conference near the home. When officers arrived, they found the door open and two men and two women dead in different parts of the home. “This is horrific,” Newsham said. “Every adjective that you can use to describe a tragedy, you can use to describe what happened here last night.” The evidence found on the scene didn’t match the details from the 911 caller, who turned out to be the suspect in the case, Newsham said. The caller – David Maine, 24, of Woodbridge – was found nearby. On Tuesday morning, Maine was charged with four counts of second-degree murder, Newsham said. Maine is being held without bond. The police chief identified the dead as Miguel Duran Flores, 44; Kelly Victoria Sotelo, 42; their daughter Karrie Ayline Sotelo, 19; and Richard Julio Jesus Revollar Corrales, 36, who lived in the basement of the home. Maine had a relationship with another resident, who was not at the home, Newsham said. That person has cooperated with police, providing valuable information, and is also upset about what happened at his home, he said.
Washington
Bremerton: Bremerton Municipal Court has shut down some public access to the court through the end of the month and cases may be continued, citing employee turnover and the COVID-19 pandemic for the court's inability to keep regular hours. The restrictions for Bremerton’s court make it the only court of limited jurisdiction in Kitsap County to institute new public access restrictions. The city courthouse was closed to the public starting on Monday, with all court hearings being held on Zoom. Court hearings will be limited, and cases will be continued as courtroom staffing allows, according to the emergency administrative order. The new restrictions could be updated or amended. Judge Tracy Flood, who took office in January, issued the emergency administrative order Sunday, citing “constantly changing issues” starting with the onset of pandemic restrictions and accommodations in March 2020.
West Virginia
Charleston: The Appalachian Regional Commission is granting $47 million to 52 projects aimed at economic diversification in communities affected by job losses in the coal industry. The funding, which comes from the commission’s POWER Initiative, will reach 181 counties. The funding is the largest to date since the initiative was launched in 2015, the commission said Monday in a statement. It is aimed at creating jobs, expanding skills training and attracting private investments to support industries such as agriculture, food and tourism. “Our coal-impacted communities are a vital part of Appalachia’s 13 states and 423 counties – when our coal communities thrive, our entire region is uplifted,” said ARC Federal Co-Chair Gayle Manchin. The POWER Initiative is funded by Congress and has invested $367 million in 447 projects throughout Appalachia, according to the commission. Hundreds of coal-fired power plants have shuttered over the last decade.
Wisconsin
Maple Grove: Sheriff’s investigators are willing to forgo any possible underage drinking violations in order to get more information about a bonfire explosion that injured more than a dozen people, including some critically, officials said Tuesday. The Shawano County Sheriff’s Office says as many as 40 current and former Pulaski High School students were at the bonfire Friday night in the Town of Maple Grove, which is about 25 miles south of Green Bay. The sheriff’s office believes the explosion was triggered when someone pushed a 55-gallon drum containing diesel fuel into the fire. Investigators say 17 people injured were p

Water crisis once again disrupts Hawaii military families’ lives

Military families in Hawaii are once again picking up potable drinking water provided by base officials, as a major water line break has forced officials to issue a “boil water” advisory for drinking water.
It affects about 93,000 residents at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, including Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Hickam, Aliamanu Military Reservation, Red Hill, Camp Smith and Pearl City Peninsula. That includes service members from all branches, their families, and civilians. Repairs are expected to take another week.
Early on Oct. 14, a 36-inch water main broke at Pearl City Peninsula, followed by two smaller breaks in other areas, one of which was caused by a vehicle accident near the Navy Exchange. Then, on Monday, a fourth water line broke, said Navy Capt. Mark Sohaney, commander of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, in a Facebook town hall. It was also in the Pearl City Peninsula area, he said, and everyone has water in the area of that fourth break, and no homes were flooded.
“The overall system remains low pressure, but stable,” he said.
The repair of the 36-inch major water main is the focus, and it’s complex, Sohaney said. “Fixing a line of this size presents an engineering challenge and there [haven’t] been any easy fixes,” he wrote in an Oct. 16 letter posted on Facebook.
The timeline for the repair is Oct. 25 -26, he said, adding that the materials are now in place to do the the work.
Residents can use the water for personal hygiene, officials said, although some residents have complained about the low water pressure making showering difficult. Water used for consumption, cooking, brushing teeth should be boiled — a rolling boil — for at least one minute. There’s a low possibility that the low water pressure could cause sediment or bacteria to get into the water, Sohaney said. Testing is being conducted each day, but results have been negative. Officials will let residents know if that changes, he said.
Officials say the water line breaks are not related to the incident in November, 2021, when the spill of an estimated 19,000 gallons of jet fuel at the massive Red Hill storage facility contaminated the Navy’s water distribution system. The Navy undertook a massive effort to purify the water and remove the fuel from water lines and homes.
The military is also beginning the process of removing the fuel from that storage facility, after defense officials agreed to shut it down permanently. Some 9,715 households in Army, Navy and Air Force neighborhoods — about 100,000 people overall — were affected, and were given the option of moving to hotels at government expense. Many lived in hotels for more than three months.

Now, many residents are back to picking up potable water being provided by base officials. Residents can pick up bottled water from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the Main Navy Exchange and at the Hickam Main exchange. Sohaney said the exchanges are keeping up with demand, and water is being delivered there each morning.
Residents are being asked to conserve water. Officials said a sudden surge in water usage before the repairs are complete could cause system-wide problems.
Commands at the joint base have been asked to use telework as much as possible to minimize manning and to only perform mission essential activities. Gyms, fitness centers and other morale, welfare and recreation center activities are closed as officials seek to minimize the number of people on the installation in order to conserve water. The dining facilities are operating as usual.
Residents are concerned about the closure of the child development centers, except for the Wahiawa center, which is located on an entirely different water system. Sohaney said officials, who are evaluating the situation day by day, hope to open one child development center on Wednesday for “absolute mission-essential personnel.” Schools, which are operated by the Hawaii Department of Education, were scheduled to be open on Tuesday.
Some families are also asking about being allowed to move to hotels until the water returns to normal. Officials note that the water is safe for bathing and doing laundry; and can be consumed if boiled for at least one minute.
But “this is too long for families to be without clean water,” said Kristina Baehr, an attorney representing some of the families who were affected by fuel contaminated water in the Navy water system.
“For this most recent event, immediately provide Temporary Lodging Assistance or hotel vouchers until water main repairs are complete,” she and her colleagues wrote in a letter to Navy officials.
They also noted that some families are continuing to report sheens and fuel in their water from the previous contamination. They asked for replacement of hot water heaters at every affected house and, for ongoing sicknesses, families be provided care by military occupational health and environmental medicine divisions.
Officials emphasized that the water line breaks are unrelated to the fuel leaks at Red Hill last year. “The fuel lines and water lines are completely separate and there is no concern of fuel leak or contamination in the drinking water as a result of the recent water main breaks,” officials stated on their information page.
But the work to empty the fuel lines at Red Hill has stopped because officials are trying to limit the number of people on the installation to decrease the amount of water being used, officials said. “Unpacking the fuel lines at Red Hill is an operation like many of the other operations that occur daily on JBPHH. Joint Task Force Red Hill is confident that the fuel in the tanks and the pipelines is currently stable.”

The Governor's Executive Order includes provisions authorizing the Supervisors of Elections in Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties to:
Extend the number of days for early voting and designate additional early voting locations. The early voting period may begin as early as Monday, October 24, 2022, and can extend through Election Day, November 8, 2022.
Allow voters in Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties to request by phone that their vote-by-mail (VBM) ballot be mailed to an address other than their address of record. Voters must still provide an appropriate form of identification in the same manner as absent uniform service and overseas voters.
Designate and provide notice of the locations for secure ballot intake stations and relocate and consolidate polling locations as necessary.
Increase the pool of eligible poll workers who may serve within Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties by making eligible any poll workers previously trained for the 2020 election cycle and thereafter and by encouraging state employees to serve as poll workers in these counties.
Governor DeSantis also directed all state agencies to render aid and assistance as needed by the Supervisors of Elections in Charlotte, Lee, and Sarasota counties. Secretary Byrd and the Department of State assessed the need for these provisions based on extensive outreach to Florida's Supervisors of Elections:
Secretary Byrd and the Division of Elections leadership conducted continuous outreach and assessed the needs and readiness of counties in or around Hurricane Ian's path, including: Charlotte, Citrus, Collier, DeSoto, Dixie, Flagler, Gilchrist, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns, Taylor, and Volusia counties.

Furthermore, Secretary Byrd participated in discussions with the Florida Supervisors of Elections (FSE). The FSE is a nonprofit association representing the Supervisors of Elections from all of Florida's 67 counties.
Lastly, since Hurricane Ian made landfall, numerous Supervisors of Elections have publicly addressed their readiness, and thankfully most have very publicly stated that Ian's impacts will not interfere with their duties. This is a testament to the resiliency of Florida's elections system.

Broken pipe has Hawaii military families under boil water advisory

A broken water main in Hawaii is behind a boil water advisory affecting around 93,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, military authorities have confirmed.
Residents are also picking up potable drinking water, with repairs to the damaged 36-inch pipe expected to last at least another week.
The water main first broke on Friday, followed by smaller breaks in two separate areas in the Pearl City Peninsula area of Honolulu. A fourth break was detected Monday.
The break is affecting nearby Ford Island as well as Pearl Harbor, Hickam, Aliamanu Military Reservation, Red Hill and Camp Smith.
"Fixing a line of this size presents an engineering challenge and there hasn't been any easy fixes," U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Sohaney, commander of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam wrote in a letter posted on Facebook.
Members from all military branches and their families are affected, as well as members of the public.
"All commanders were also asked to minimize manning and to only perform mission essential activities. These measures will reduce the stress on the remaining capacity of the potable water system," Sohaney wrote.
"A boil water advisory remains in effect. Water can continue to be used for personal hygiene, but all water used for consumption, cooking, brushing teeth, etc. should be boiled for at least one minute. The overall system remains low pressure, but stable."
This isn't the first time the same communities have had to deal with water issues.
Last November, 19,377 gallons of jet fuel and other contaminants from the Red Hill Bulk fuel storage facility leaked into the drinking water system, forcing thousands of families to evacuate their homes.
More than 93,000 military service members, family members and civilians relied on the government for safe drinking water.
At the end of August, four families filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Navy over the jet fuel leaks that contaminated Pearl Harbor water on Oahu, Hawaii, temporarily forcing them out of their homes.
The families filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, accusing the Navy of releasing the contaminants.
The lawsuit contends families suffered gastrointestinal disorders, neurological issues, burns, rashes, lesions, thyroid abnormalities, migraines and other maladies.

JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR, Oct. 19 -- Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Korea, issued the following news release:
Base leadership is optimistic these repairs are an important step towards lifting the boil water advisory as early as this weekend. Several steps need to be taken to restore the system to its designed capacity, including the slow introduction of water back into the system to restore pressure and system health. After pressure is restored, additional sampling for bacteria will be conducted to verify the safety of the water. Those test samples will be sent to a state approved third-party local laboratory in Hawaii. These results are expected back in one to two days. The boil water advisory will only be lifted when those test results are negative.
"I want to thank our contracted partners, Dawson, Hawaiian Dredging and Coffman Engineering, who worked hand-in-hand with my Public Works Department," said CAPT Mark Sohaney, Joint Base commander. "I would also like to thank the Board of Water Supply for their continued support and allowing the Navy to connect to their system."
While water pressure is restored, family housing residents and other users of the Joint Base water system may see fluctuations in water pressure, sediment and a slight smell of chlorine, as well as have air pockets in their water. Residents may also see workers opening up fire hydrants that will help to equalize water pressure throughout the system.

By Associated Press The Navy said Tuesday it was still fixing an underground water pipe that ruptured last week and interrupted the supply of water to about 93,000 people at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The bursting of the 36-inch water main has also forced the Navy to postpone plans to remove 1 million gallons of fuel from three pipelines at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, the tank farm that leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor's tap water last year. 
Navy Capt. Mark Sohaney, the commander of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, said Tuesday that crews were on schedule to finish fixing the broken water main in about one week. When the water main burst last Friday, officials had to divert water to the west side of the base. That increased pressure in smaller water lines there, leading to additional pipe breaks in Pearl City Peninsula and West Loch. These two smaller breaks have since been repaired. The Navy issued a boil-water advisory for affected areas last Friday, and gyms and child care centers have been closed. Sohaney told reporters he expects to reopen most of the base's 12 child care centers Wednesday. The water problems forced Joint Task Force Red Hill to delay plans it had for this week to drain fuel from three pipelines connecting the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility to fuel points on the base. The Navy needs to remove fuel from these pipes to prepare for the eventual closure of the World War II storage tanks. It plans to finish draining 100 million gallons of fuel from the tanks by July 2024 and close the facility afterward.

HONOLULU (AP) — The Navy said Tuesday it was still fixing an underground water pipe that ruptured last week and interrupted the supply of water to about 93,000 people at Pearl Harbor.
The bursting of the 36-inch (91-centimeter) water main has also forced the Navy to postpone plans to remove 1 gallons (3.79 million liters) of fuel from three pipelines at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, the tank farm that leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor's tap water last year.

The massive 2021 infrastructure act aimed to fight climate change. Is it living up to Biden's pledge?

When President Joe Biden signed the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act last November – commonly known as the bipartisan infrastructure bill – he and other proponents noted it would be the largest investment in infrastructure in a generation.
But they also promised it would be something else: a historic effort to tackle climate change. Although it didn't devote hundreds of billions of dollars directly to the climate fight as the Inflation Reduction Act did this year, the administration said the infrastructure bill would help transition the nation to cleaner sources of energy while electrifying the transportation sector and preparing roads and bridges for a changing world.
“President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal passed by Congress will strengthen our nation’s resilience to extreme weather and climate change while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expanding access to clean drinking water, building up a clean power grid, and more,” a statement from the White House asserted in November 2021.
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL: 'We're finally getting this done': Biden signs landmark infrastructure package in major win for domestic agenda
Promises were numerous:
 
•	Roads and bridges: $110 billion to “repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety." 
•	More public transit: $105 billion for public transit and rail, which would “eliminate the Amtrak maintenance backlog” and otherwise cut down greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by electrifying public transit. 
•	Better grid: $65 billion for “the largest investment in clean energy transmission and the electric grid in American history.” 
•	Cleaner water: $15 billion to “replace all of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines” and about $35 billion more to further upgrade drinking and wastewater infrastructure. 
•	EV chargers: $7.5 billion to “build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States."

Experts say that as funding from the law begins to roll out, Americans will soon see upgrades like electric school buses, followed by a growing network of electric vehicle charging stations. But they also warn that funding from the bill probably won't result in dramatic changes in the way Americans and electricity move throughout the country, limiting the overall climate impact.
USA TODAY spoke to a variety of climate and transportation experts to look more closely at whether the bill's promises are meeting reality.
Bill likely won't lead to transportation transformation
Though experts said it's too early to fully judge the bill on its climate merits – spending will primarily be portioned out over five or 10 years – many agreed on two conclusions.
First, the bill is indeed historic in its commitment of money and focus on climate. Experts said that in most cases the Biden administration is working diligently to ensure a good rollout. Among other measures, the U.S. Department of Transportation is crafting a new regulation to pair about $27 billion in funding with an effort for states to track and lower greenhouse emissions from transportation.

MORE ON CLIMATE CHANGE: Elon Musk says 'population collapse' is a bigger threat than climate change. Is he right?
But others say that because of continued prioritization of roads and cars and a lack of accountability at the state level, they don't expect the bill to revolutionize the transportation or energy sectors, which together account for more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
"Most Americans do not have access to transit or certainly not good transit," said Beth Osborne, director of the national nonprofit Transportation for America. “We have a lot of work to do."

Much of the past year was spent simply laying the groundwork for awarding the funding. Money will start to roll out this fall or early next year.
Experts say administration officials have moved swiftly to set funding stipulations that meet many climate and policy groups' wish lists. Most feel the administration is doing about all it can to ensure climate change remains a priority once money is awarded to states and cities, which will actually do the spending.
“There's still a lot to do, but they've made a lot of progress since the law was enacted,” said Deron Lovaas, a senior policy adviser with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.
But experts warn the devil's in the details, and many won't be revealed until further down the line.
Mixed results from projects with early rollouts
Of projects that have had early rollouts, results are mixed.
On one end of the spectrum, cities and schools are clamoring for money for electric school buses, generating a buzz of excitement about a rapid transition in the years ahead.
Money to replace lead service lines sits on the other side of the ledger. Experts have noted that the allocated $15 billion doesn't nearly match the actual cost of replacing every lead drinking water pipe across the country.
With the first year of state-by-state funding for lead service line replacements already set in stone, local lawmakers in states like New Jersey are decrying a formula they say unfairly awards more money to some states.Because the formula was based on overall infrastructure needs instead of the number of actual lead service lines, an NRDC analysis found states like Ohio and New Jersey get only about $100 per lead pipe, while Hawaii receives $10,000.
Link to Image
“It is shocking that the reported plan for the distribution of these funds gives some states thousands of dollars per pipe ... while the most impacted states are left to bear almost the entire cost of replacement themselves,” New Jersey state senators Troy Singleton and Linda Greenstein wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The EPA says it is working to fix its funding formula in the second year of the program, but the problem points to a wider truth, experts say: The bill's money is not going to fully address the nation's infrastructure and environmental challenges.
Car infrastructure gets boost from road and highway funding
Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the nonprofit Center for American Progress, noted that the lion's share of the bill's new spending – $110 billion – is earmarked for traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges.
That, in itself, can be problematic. For much of the past century, America's spending on transportation has revolved around the automobile, with interstate highway systems feasting as public transportation systems like trains and subways starved. Because cars and trucks emit large quantities of carbon dioxide, that legacy has now made transportation the largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any sector in the U.S. economy.
“So many people are locked into driving, because that's the only thing we built for,” DeGood said.
The fact that the bill continues to spend heavily on roadways signals that the automobile still reigns supreme. Further complicating the matter, DeGood said, is that the $110 billion in additional road and bridge funding is largely distributed to 52 state Department of Transportation agencies, including those in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
Link to Image
Those agencies have some flexibility in how they use the money, including for public transportation. But DeGood says that historically such departments have focused on cars by expanding roadways and building new ones and that there is little to suggest this time will be different.
When state DOT administrators “wake up in the morning,” DeGood said, “they think in terms of congestion and road widening.”
The first year of boosted road and bridge funding has already rolled out the door, and oversight on how much is actually going to climate-friendly projects is difficult because of the slushiness of state budgets, DeGood said.
Groundwork starts on electric vehicle charging station network
Reliance on the automobile can be less problematic if cars and trucks on the road are running on electricity.
Max Baumhefner, a senior attorney with the NRDC who watches the electric vehicle space, said there's mostly good news on the effort to build out a promised nationwide network of charging stations.
ELECTRIC CARS: Rolls-Royce unveils its first electric car, begins 'all-electric' goal
CHARGING TIME: NASA says its space tech could cut electric car charging times to 5 minutes or less
Although he says it will be a year or two before Americans see chargers paid for by the bill physically installed, he adds that the U.S. Department of Transportation worked swiftly to launch a National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which will divvy up the $5 billion set aside for electric vehicle charging stations.
Link to Image
Just three months after the bill passed, the program released guidelines for states to apply for the money. Baumhefner approves of the criteria, which he says emphasizes the installation of the latest generation of fast-charging stations located strategically along heavily traveled highways.
“Fast charging is getting a lot faster,” Baumhefner said. “We're seeing a move toward charging that gets you back on the road after a cup of coffee and a bathroom break, where before it was more like stopping for lunch.”
Another $2.5 billion is earmarked for a separate community grant program that Baumhefner predicts will mostly be used to build out local charging stations. The Inflation Reduction Act passed this summer offers further billions to complement charging station development. 
But Baumhefner warns of a downside: Estimates show the U.S. probably will need to spend at least $40 billion on public EV charging stations just to meet its 2030 climate goals. And that doesn't include what it will cost to charge medium- and heavy-duty vehicles like tractor trailers or hit even larger 2050 targets.
“The bottom line is that it's a historic investment, but it's not alone sufficient,” Baumhefner said.
Public transit and rail gets a smaller portion of funding
Osborne, with Transportation for America, says it's a similar story for public transportation and railways.
The bill allocated more money than ever for public transportation, which she says will largely address much-needed maintenance backlogs in cities and towns across the country. Although much of the money has yet to be used, Americans can expect to see lots of minor improvements in the years ahead: faster subways and trolleys as rail lines are repaired, older train cars and buses replaced with nicer new ones, and more frequent service.
Link to Image
Amtrak received a particularly big boost, a nearly ninefold increase in funding from the last major transportation bill in 2015.
And perhaps the most visible transformation to Americans will be school buses. The infrastructure bill devoted $5 billion to replacing gas-powered school buses nationwide with ones running on electricity or other zero-emission fuels. In September, the EPA announced it was nearly doubling the amount of first-year funding, from $500 to $965 million, after school districts bombarded it with applications.
The agency expects to release a list of awardees this month.
“We’re working across all 50 states to accelerate the transition to a future where clean, zero-emissions school buses are the American standard,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.
But Osborne says there are still a lot of question marks on public transportation.
A simple boost in funding isn't enough on its own, she says, noting that federal and state officials still need to build out programs to successfully use the money. Often, such efforts can get bogged down by politics and special interests.
In one particularly thorny example, Osborne says, Amtrak wants to upgrade passenger service along the Gulf Coast on railways owned by CSX, a private company. But she says CSX has largely rebuffed the efforts based on cost claims, and the matter is now before a federal review board. How aggressively the administration approaches the dispute could foretell how serious it is about public transit.
“There is a failure to regulate and manage the rail owners according to the law,” Osborne said. “The administration has to get that straight.”
Link to Image
And even if policies ultimately complement the funding, Osborne says, results are still mitigated by the fact that the car remains king. There's more money than ever for rail and public transit, but the same is true for roads and highways. With the latter still getting about 80% of the pie, Osborne has serious doubts on how far the needle will move in the effort to lower greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.
“It's almost entirely status quo,” Osborne said. “If we really want to make a big difference on climate and equity ... we need to build tons and tons more public transit.”
Power grid still can't support climate change goals
Experts say the country also needs to build vast amounts of new high-power transmission lines to support the shift to renewables and cut emissions from the energy sector, the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after transportation.
Rob Gramlich, president of power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies LLC, says such lines are essential to ensuring wind, solar and other green energy sources can travel vast distances to population centers. Demand for renewable energy generation is growing, as it is for electric cars and devices. But transmission lines linking the two are falling far behind.
“What that tells you is this going to be the big issue of the next few years,” Gramlich said.
Link to Image
On paper, the infrastructure bill devoted $81 billion to the energy grid and power sector, the second-biggest pot of money after roads and bridges. In promoting the bill, the White House promised “thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy.”
But, Gramlich said, the bill provided very little funding for the actual construction of such transmission lines. Most of the power and grid money made available under the law is broken into a diverse constellation of small programs, from carbon capture infrastructure to blackout prevention to nuclear energy.
A program to fund high-voltage power lines, the Transmission Facilitation Program, received just $2.5 billion and operates on a loan basis.
“That's about one month's worth of transmission spending in the country," Gramlich said. “It's marginally helpful but a far cry from anything transformative.”
More funding for water, but big challenges remain
In addition to climate change, the infrastructure bill promised to address another pressing human and environmental priority: water.
The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. wastewater infrastructure a D-plus, with drinking water fairing only slightly better at a C-plus. A recent systemwide collapse that put more than 150,000 residents of Jackson, Mississippi, under a boil-water advisory highlighted the harm that can come from neglect.
The infrastructure bill promised to address such problems. It pumped about $50 billion into the water sector, about a fivefold increase over prior funding levels.
That's welcome news in cities such as El Paso, Texas, where a fresh infusion of $20 million from the bill will help pay for an advanced water recycling facility set to begin construction next year, bringing a sustainable water source to the drought-stricken city.
“This facility is the game changer in the nation’s efforts to secure safe and reliable water supply for ratepayers throughout the West and nationwide,” Pat Sinicropi, executive director of the trade group WateReuse Association, told the El Paso Times.

But advocates say that while funding in the bill is transformative for some such cities, the money will fall short across the entire country.
“I do wish people would stop calling it a once-in-a-generation bill,” said Becky Hammer, deputy director of federal water policy at NRDC. “Because we need more investment this generation.”
Erik Olson, a senior strategist at NRDC, said that spread over five years, new money in the bill for water infrastructure comes out to about $10 billion annually. That's a significant boost over regular funding levels, which average less than $3 billion. But with some estimates calling for more than $1 trillion to fully address the nation's water problems, that means it could still take centuries to clear a national backlog unless Congress continues to significantly increase funding.
As with money for transportation, the bill's water funding also flows through state agencies, which are subject to their own whims and often award money to politically connected and wealthy communities. Olson points to reporting around Jackson, which indicates state officials historically steered money away from the majority-Black city, to highlight the problem.

“Unless EPA and states can figure out a way around ... it's going to remain challenging to make sure this money goes to communities that need it most,” Olson said.

Alabama
Birmingham: A judicial panel convicted a judge of violating ethics rules by failing to return to work and serve without pay following her conviction in an earlier ethics case, court documents show. Jefferson County Circuit Judge Tracie Todd was given a 120-day suspension without pay in an order filed Monday following a trial that lasted five days over three months before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary. Todd was convicted last year of violating orders of an appellate court and, as punishment, ordered to work for 90 days without pay beginning last Dec. 6, news outlets reported. Rather than reporting for duty at the courthouse in Birmingham, Todd remained for most of the period in Chicago, where her husband and children live, evidence showed. 
Todd, who testified in her own defense, claimed she worked remotely while in Chicago and couldn’t return to Alabama because of illness and COVID-19 quarantines that restricted her from travel. The court could have permanently removed Todd, and one of her lawyers, Edward J. Ungvarsky, said the decision to only suspend her for four months represented a vindication. “Judges, lawyers, and court personnel consistently testified that Judge Todd displays the greatest of integrity, honesty, and compassion,” Ungvarsky said. The Court of the Judiciary convicted Todd in December 2021 of violating judicial ethics by disregarding decisions by higher courts and inserting her own opinions into rulings, including one that declared Alabama’s death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court overturned the decision.
Alaska
Anchorage: The Anchorage Assembly leadership is condemning remarks made by a member of the public during last week’s Assembly meeting, Alaska Public Media reports. When testifying on an ordinance about designating a former hotel as a temporary emergency shelter, a man made racist and derogatory comments about Alaska Native people, according to the news outlet. East Anchorage Assembly member Forrest Dunbar swiftly rebuked the comments. In a statement Tuesday, Assembly chair Suzanne LaFrance and vice-chair Chris Constant said they wanted to “speak out against the racist and offensive statements made by the member of the public. Unfortunately, this is not the first time racist views have been expressed in the Assembly Chambers.”
Arizona
Tucson: A man convicted last month in the first of two murder cases is seeking a new trial, according to authorities. Christopher Clements was convicted Sept. 30 of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death of 13-year-old Maribel Gonzalez. He was scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday in Pima County Superior Court, but the date has been moved to Nov. 14. Court officials also said Clements’ attorneys have filed a motion for a new trial and a motion for judgment of acquittal not withstanding the verdict. A Nov. 7 hearing is set for both motions. A judge also will hear testimony Nov. 14 for a possible change of venue for Clements’ other murder trial, scheduled for Feb. 2 involving the death of 6-year-old Isabel Celis. Clements, a 40-year-old convicted sex offender with a long criminal record, is facing life in prison when he’s sentenced in the Gonzalez case. Clements was arrested in 2018 and indicted on 22 felony counts including two counts each of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the girls’ deaths.
Arkansas
Fort Smith: Fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that is often mixed with illegal drugs such as methamphetamine or heroin, is continuing to cause more overdoses and deaths in Fort Smith and the state. Fort Smith emergency responders have saved the lives of 66 people who overdosed on fentanyl this year with the life-saving Narcan drug that can counter the deadly effects of fentanyl and opiates. Fort Smith police report that paramedics, firefighters and others have given 194 doses of Narcan that could have resulted in deadly overdoses. Of those lives that have have been saved, 66 people were confirmed to have fentanyl in their system with an additional 31 people overdosing on unconfirmed substances and pills possibly with fentanyl.
California
San Diego: A motorcyclist and Navy veteran who lost a leg in a 2019 chain-reaction crash started by a Navy sailor driving a military van near San Diego has won a $10.8 million settlement against the United States. Attorneys for the motorcyclist, Peter Arthur, said the settlement is one of the largest against the federal government in the San Diego area for a suit involving a vehicle collision, the San Diego Union Tribune reported. Arthur, a 49-year-old who served 20 years in the U.S. Navy, underwent multiple surgeries following the Sept. 13, 2019, crash. Arthur was thrown from his motorcycle, causing the femur, tibia and fibula in his right leg to shatter, according to his civil lawsuit. Doctors eventually had to amputate the leg above the knee. Navy sailor Michael Stanley Reynolds was driving a large passenger van on Interstate 5 when he “suddenly and without warning” swerved into the next lane to his left, causing several vehicles to crash, according to the lawsuit. Reynolds did not face criminal charges in connection with the crash. A Navy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by the Union-Tribune. Arthur’s civil lawsuit against the federal government alleges his injuries were “permanent, disfiguring, and disabling” and “will require extensive future medical care, life care, and vocational rehabilitation.”
Colorado
Fort Collins: Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences recently announced a $278  million upgrade and expansionof its current vet school facilities on the university’s south campus. The new veterinary health complex, which is scheduled to break ground in early 2023 and be completed in 2028, will include an expansion of more than 300,000 square feet. The complex will have a veterinary education center and primary care clinic, and there will be renovations or expansions of current facilities, including a livestock teaching hospital and an animal specialty hospital. The school’s current teaching hospital off of Drake Road and College Avenue will be remodeled to become the animal specialty hospital. All work will be done in phases, so some elements will be completed prior to 2028. “Our college ranks among the world’s top institutions in veterinary and biomedical education and research,” said Sue VandeWoude, dean of the college, in the university’s release. “Our expansion plan for the south campus … will help us continue our tradition of excellence in the academic mission of teaching; the assessment of novel methods for training clinical students; and our research and service to the community.” With the new buildings come curricula changes, too. The new facilities will give CSU what it needs to implement a new curriculum focused on educating “day one-ready” veterinarians using medical training along with training in “problem-solving, conflict resolution, decision-making and mental, physical and financial wellbeing,” according to a release from the university.
Connecticut
Waterbury: Less than a week after two police officers were killed in an ambush, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes called for a national ban on assault weapons, while her Republican challenger, George Logan, stressed that more needs to be done to support law enforcement. The two are locked in a closely watched race for the state’s 5th Congressional District that has attracted more than $5 million in outside money. Appearing in their first televised debate, the pair was asked about a shooting that left two officers dead in Bristol, about 20 minutes away from where the debate was held. Hayes said officers like her husband, a 25-year-veteran of the Waterbury Police Department, can be outgunned. Noting that the state already has an assault weapons ban, Logan criticized Hayes for voting in favor of what he called an “anti-police bill.” He was referring to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which banned chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement while creating national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability. The bill was later blocked in the Senate.
Delaware
New Castle: A state trooper indicted last year for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and official misconduct in New Castle County Superior Court on Monday, the Delaware Department of Justice said. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9 before his suspension in May 2021, was sentenced to a year of probation and 33 hours of community service – one hour for every false e-warning he filed. He also had to surrender his Council on Police Training certifications. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings called Ramirez’s traffic warning scheme an “abuse of power” and said it “victimized innocent motorists,” some of whom did not even know they had received an e-warning. Others weren’t even driving when the fraudulent traffic stop supposedly occurred. Ramirez was officially sentenced to two concurrent yearlong prison sentences. It was suspended for a year of probation. Delaware State Police Superintendent Colonel Melissa Zebley noted in a written statement that Ramirez is no longer employed by the statewide police department.
District of Columbia
Washington: Metro Transit Police investigators are looking into an incident captured on video in which a woman was attacked and thrown off a bus, WUSA-TV reports. The woman said she was on the bus, which was headed to Deanwood on Monday afternoon, with her two children when a group of kids got on the bus and started cursing and acting rowdy, according to the news outlet. Things escalated and eventually turned physical when the woman asked the kids to stop cursing, according to the person who filmed the footage. At least three people can be seen grabbing the woman and pushing her out the door when the bus came to a stop, the news outlet reports.
Florida
Fort Myers: The state has seen an increase in cases of flesh-eating bacteria this year driven largely by a surge in the county hit hardest by Hurricane Ian. The state Department of Health reports that as of Friday there have been 65 cases of vibrio vulnificus infections and 11 deaths in Florida this year. That compares with 34 cases and 10 deaths reported during all of 2021. In Lee County, where Ian stormed ashore last month, the health department reports 29 cases this year and four deaths. Health officials didn’t give a breakdown of how many of the cases were before or after Ian struck. Lee County health officials earlier this month warned people that the post-hurricane environment – including warm, standing water – could pose a danger from the potentially deadly bacteria. “Flood waters and standing waters following a hurricane pose many risks, including infectious diseases such as vibrio vulnificus,” the county health department said in a news release Oct. 3 that urged the public to take precautions. The advisory said that people with open wounds, cuts, or scratches can be exposed to the bacteria through contact with sea water or brackish water. People with open wounds should avoid such water and seek medical care immediately if an infection is apparent.
Georgia
Atlanta: Two former jail detainees testified that deputies of a sheriff charged with violating their civil rights kept them in restraint chairs for hours, causing them to urinate on themselves while they were bound. Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill is standing trial on federal charges that he violated the rights of seven detainees. Prosecutors say their placement in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment and caused pain and bodily injury. Hill is widely known as one of metro Atlanta’s most flamboyant lawmen. He calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery to promote himself on social media and in campaign ads. This is his second trial on criminal charges. Clayton County voters reelected Hill in 2012 while he was under indictment the first time, accused of using his office for personal gain. He beat those charges. Hill has pleaded not guilty to the civil rights charges, which his attorneys say are politically motivated. Drew Findling, one of Hill’s lawyers, cross-examined both men Tuesday about what he said where inconsistencies between their trial testimony and what they had previously told investigators.
Hawaii
Pearl Harbor: The Navy said Tuesday it was still fixing an underground water pipe that ruptured last week and interrupted the supply of water to about 93,000 people at Pearl Harbor. The bursting of the 36-inch water main has also forced the Navy to postpone plans to remove 1 gallon of fuel from three pipelines at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, the tank farm that leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year. Navy Capt. Mark Sohaney, the commander of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, said crews were on schedule to finish fixing the broken water main in about one week. When the water main burst last Friday, officials had to divert water to the west side of the base. That increased pressure in smaller water lines there, leading to additional pipe breaks in Pearl City Peninsula and West Loch. These two smaller breaks have since been repaired. The Navy issued a boil water advisory for affected areas last Friday, and gyms and child care centers have been closed.
Idaho
Boise: A legal loophole in the state that allows parents of teens to nullify child custody agreements by arranging child marriages will remain in effect, under a ruling from the state Supreme Court on Tuesday. In a split decision, the high court declined to decide whether Idaho’s child marriage law – which allows 16- and 17-year-olds to marry if one parent agrees to the union – is unconstitutional. Instead, the justices said that once a child is emancipated by marriage, the family court loses jurisdiction over custody matters. The case arose from a custody battle between a Boise woman and her ex-husband, who planned to move to Florida and wanted to take their 16-year-old daughter along. The ex-husband was accused of setting up a “sham marriage” between his daughter and another teen as a way to end the custody fight.
Illinois
Chicago: Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker and Republican challenger Darren Bailey traded barbs at the final gubernatorial debate Tuesday. The debate held at the WGN-TV studios featured many of the same topics as the prior debate at Illinois State University including crime, abortion and the SAFE-T Act. However, new wrinkles were added in the hourlong back and forth such as school curriculum and the possibility of a new stadium for the Chicago Bears. While questions primarily focused on the issues, both candidates landed punches with Pritzker calling Bailey a “threat to democracy” and Bailey labeling Chicago “Pritzkerville” because of crime in the city. It was the last scheduled televised debate between the candidates and possibly the last time they shared venues, giving Bailey perhaps his last chance to cut into Pritzker’s lead in the polls. Recent polling conducted by The Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ found the Democrat with 49% of voters supporting him compared to 34% for Bailey.
Indiana
Indianapolis: A man has been convicted of reckless homicide in the fatal 2020 shooting of a young Black man during unrest sparked by outrage over George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. Prosecutors had charged Tyler Newby, 32, with murder, but after a one-day bench trial a Marion County judge found Newby, who is white, guilty Monday of the lesser crime of reckless homicide in Dorian Murrell’s death. His sentencing was set for Nov. 10. Murrell, 18, died from a single gunshot wound to the heart after being shot in downtown Indianapolis on May 31, 2020, during violence that followed protests over the death of Floyd, a Black man. Newby’s first trial in Murrell’s killing ended in a mistrial last year after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict following several hours of deliberation. Newby turned himself in shortly after the shooting. He claimed self defense, saying the shooting took place after he was approached by a group of people and shoved to the ground. Newby said he saw someone standing over him and fired. Prosecutors argued that being shoved to the ground wasn’t justification to take someone’s life. Three people who had been with Murrell when he was shot have been charged in connection with the robbery and killing of Chris Beaty, a businessman and a former Indiana University football player. Beaty, 38, was fatally shot in downtown Indianapolis hours before Murrell was slain.
Iowa
Des Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds now has the support of a majority of likely Iowa voters – and a sizable lead over her competitors with just over three weeks until Election Day. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds Reynolds at 52% support, holding a 17-percentage point advantage over Democrat Deidre DeJear, who has 35%. Libertarian Rick Stewart trails at 4%. Another 4% of likely voters say they are not sure for whom they would vote, 3% say they would vote for “someone else,” and 1% say they would not vote. Reynolds is holding her large lead even as more Iowans solidify their support behind one of the two major-party candidates. Reynolds also enjoyed a 17-point margin in the previous Iowa Poll in July, even though her overall support was lower in that poll, at 48%, versus 31% for DeJear. Fewer Iowans now say they’re undecided or would vote for “someone else,” but support for both Reynolds and DeJear increased equally – by 4 percentage points – since the July poll. And Reynolds maintains a significant advantage over DeJear in name recognition: Among all Iowans, more than half, 51%, still don’t know enough about DeJear to form an opinion about her, versus only 3% for Reynolds, the poll found. Reynolds also enjoys her highest approval rating since fall of 2021, at 53%.
Kansas
Lawrence: The University of Kansas has begun the process of returning Native American remains and other sacred objects that were recently discovered in its museum collections, the university said. University officials said in a statement posted online that “culturally unidentified individual remains,” funeral objects and other sacred objects were found in Spooner Hall and Lippincott Hall Annex on the Lawrence campus. The university is verifying its inventory of Indigenous artifacts it holds across campus. A spokesperson did not respond Tuesday to questions about the number of artifacts, specifically how and when they were found, or to which tribes they belong. The announcement comes 32 years after the passage of the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which sets out criteria for tribal nations to reclaim human remains and other objects related to burials. Kansas Chancellor Douglas Girod initially announced the discovery in a message to the campus Sept. 20. The university had begun efforts to repatriate some items in the past, but the process was not completed, he said. The university said its repatriation efforts will include forming an advisory committee, consulting with tribal nations, auditing all university collections, securing space for the Indigenous Studies Program, supporting gathering opportunities for the university’s Native American community, and instituting repatriation policies and procedures. “The intent in sharing this announcement is to publicly apologize to Native communities and peoples, past, present, and future, and to apologize to the tribal nations across North America,” the university’s statement said.
Kentucky
Burkesville: The state’s 26th Trail Town has been certified, and it is in Cumberland County, the Department of Parks said. “Trail Towns are ideal destinations for outdoor recreation lovers,” Parks Commissioner Russ Meyer said in a news release Tuesday. “The program helps drive local and state economies and is an ever-increasing component of the nation’s economic impact. It also brings about more healthy activities and vibrant communities and parks.” The program is designed to provide a strategic plan that communities can use to capitalize on travel opportunities, the agency said. It also works to create healthy physical activities with access to trails and recreational areas. The Burkesville Trail Town offerings feature the Cumberland River and the connection to the downtown area. The river offers boating, fishing, and paddling. Burkesville is also home to Dale Hollow Lake State Resort Park.
Louisiana
New Orleans: An outage involving a Coast Guard marine warning system and “data gaps” in radar systems were factors in last year’s deadly capsize of an oil industry vessel during severe storms off of Louisiana’s coast, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report issued Tuesday. Thirteen of the 19 people aboard the Seacor Power died after the offshore vessel capsized in the Gulf after leaving Port Fourchon. Known as a lift boat, the vessel had three legs that could be lowered to the sea floor, converting the ship to an offshore platform for servicing oil and gas facilities. It had been chartered by Talos Energy LLC for work on a Gulf platform when it was hit by high winds in rough seas and capsized on April 13, 2021. An NTSB preliminary report had said the Seacor Power had begun to lower its stabilizing legs and was trying to turn to face heavy winds when it flipped in the Gulf of Mexico. Six people were rescued. The NTSB said in Tuesday’s report that the captain of the Seacor Power made a “reasonable” decision to get underway the day of the disaster. But he didn’t have sufficient weather information from the lift boat company. “Additionally, due to a Coast Guard broadcasting station outage, the SEACOR Power crew did not receive a National Weather Service Special Marine Warning notifying mariners of a severe thunderstorm that was approaching,” the report said.
Maine
Machias: A longtime law enforcement officer and former candidate for sheriff in Washington County has been sentenced to four years in prison for drug- and gun-related charges. The case against Jeffrey Bishop, 55, unfolded with his arrest for providing opioid pills to a teenage girl last year in a high school parking lot. Prosecutors said the drugs were meant for the girl’s mother. He told the judge Monday that he was “very humble” and a “very broken man” but said he wasn’t fully satisfied with the plea agreement, the Bangor Daily News reported. He also said he was “baffled” that his police background was considered an aggravating factor when it came to his sentencing. He was arrested less than a week after he retired from the Calais Police Department last year. In his resignation letter, Bishop said he “decided to go out on top,” after a long career in law enforcement.
Maryland
Hagerstown: Gov. Larry Hogan and other political and business leaders Tuesday toured the Hitachi Rail factory being built in Washington County. “The job creation potential and associated economic benefits are an absolute game-changer for this region and for the entire state,” the Republican governor said in remarks before the tour. “This project is further proof that the Hagerstown region is a major logistical center for transportation with unparalleled connections to the northeastern United States.” Hitachi also unveiled the final design of the $70 million factory, which will employ about 460 people and help sustain a total of 1,300 jobs in the region. The 307,000-square-foot facility is being build at the west end of Halfway Boulevard, which the county plans to extend to Greencastle Pike (Md. 63). The 41-acre site also will include an 800-foot test track. Hogan called it a “transformative project.” Construction is slated to be finished in the first quarter of 2024.
Massachusetts
Salem: A Hindu rights activist is calling on a museum to stop selling children’s plush toys representing three Hindu deities. Toys depicting Lord Krishna, Lord Ganesh and Lord Hanuman were available on the Peabody Essex Museum’s online shop last week but had been removed by Tuesday, Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, said in a statement. The deities are “greatly revered in Hinduism and were meant to be worshipped in temples or home shrines and not to be thrown around loosely on the floor, bathrooms, cars, etc.” Zed said. He also called for a formal apology from the museum. The Peabody Essex Museum halted sales of the toys while it reviewed the complaint, spokesperson Whitney Van Dyke said in an email. “These items will be back on sale shortly,” she said. The museum pointed out that the toys are widely available and are manufactured by New Jersey-based Modi Toys, founded by an Indian American family. They are intended to spark curiosity in Hindu culture and heritage, company co-founder Avani Modi Sarkar said in a statement.
Michigan
Mount Pleasant: A man who got out of his car after striking a deer was killed by another vehicle, authorities said. The 33-year-old Shepherd man was hit Monday when the driver of the second car swerved to avoid a crash on U.S. 127, near Mount Pleasant, investigators said. Conditions were dark and misty. The lights on Joshua Davis’ Ford Focus “had been disabled from the deer accident and were not working,” the Isabella County sheriff’s office said. The driver of the other vehicle, a 77-year-old woman from Lansing, was taken to an emergency room for an evaluation, the sheriff’s office said.
Minnesota
Bloomington: The Mall of America is testing metal detectors at one entrance following two incidents of gunfire and an armed robbery within the last year. Mall spokeswoman Laura Utecht said Tuesday the trial is taking place over the next month at the mall’s north doors, although that could change as testing continues. She declined to say what shoppers should avoid trying to carry through the metal detectors, the Star Tribune reported. “With Mall of America being such a unique property, it is important to thoroughly evaluate this technology onsite to ensure its accuracy, effectiveness and efficiency,” Utecht said in a statement, adding that the mall is testing a variety of security options. The Mall of America bans guns, according to its website, but the shopping center has never had metal detectors or searched bags. The mall, which opened in 1992, is the largest in the U.S. and is a tourist destination and community gathering spot. Two gun incidents took place in August. In one, a man robbed two stores and was apprehended with a loaded rifle. About three weeks earlier, a man fired shots in the midst of a fight among four other people. There were no injuries in either case. A shooting last New Year’s Eve left two people wounded following a dispute on the mall’s third floor.
Mississippi
Jackson: An employee of a wastewater hauling company pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday for his part in illegally discharging industrial waste into the capital city’s sewer system. William Roberts, an employee of Partridge-Sibley Industrial Services, admitted to supervising the improper disposal of industrial waste at a commercial entity in Jackson. As a result of Roberts’s negligence, the waste was trucked and hauled to a facility that was not a legal discharge point designated to receive the waste, federal prosecutors said. “The defendant’s negligent conduct contributed to the discharge of millions of gallons of untreated industrial waste into the Jackson water system,” said Chuck Carfagno, a special agent for the Environmental Protection Agency’s criminal investigations division. Jackson’s water and sewer system has been beset by troubles dating back years. The water system was recently engulfed in a crisis that forced people in the city of 150,000 to go days without running water in late August and early September. An attorney for Roberts did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He will be sentenced on December 14, 2022.
Missouri
Kansas City: Six students and two adults were taken to a hospital for evaluation after a carbon monoxide leak was detected Wednesday at an elementary school, officials said. The eight people taken to hospitals from Longfellow Elementary School suffered nausea and dizziness but none suffered life-threatening issues, Assistant Fire Chief Jimmy Walker said. Emergency responders went to the school after several students reporting feeling ill. Firefighters found “extremely high” levels of the lethal gas inside the building, Walker said. The level of carbon monoxide reached 2,000 parts per million, which was the maximum for monitors used by firefighters at the scene, Walker said. The cause of the leak is under investigation. Firefighters were ventilating the building but it was unclear when students could return to Longfellow. School district spokesperson Elle Moxley said the district had contractors check its heating systems last week, including at Longfellow, in anticipation of colder weather. No problems were detected, she said. Moxley said every child was checked and the district will work with the fire department before determining where Longfellow students will attend school this week.
Montana
Great Falls: A suspect who is accused of leading law enforcement on a vehicle chase through two counties on Monday has been charged with five felonies in Cascade County District Court. He is being held on a $500,000 bond. Santana Ledeau is charged with two counts of robbery, two counts of assault on a peace officer and one count of criminal endangerment. Cascade County Attorney Josh Racki said on Monday that Ledeau will likely face more charges as the investigation continues. That investigation, Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said, will be conducted by the Montana Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation due to the many agencies involved.
Nebraska
Lincoln: Officials say improperly discarded cigarettes led to a fire in a home’s garage and caused $75,000 worth of damage, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Lincoln Fire and Rescue Capt. Nancy Crist said the fire started after the resident emptied an ashtray into a garbage can. The blaze was contained to the garage and no one was injured, according to the news outlet.
Nevada
Reno: Republican Secretary of State candidate Jim Marchant is the only statewide candidate who has yet to file his campaign finance report, having missed Monday’s deadline. A central duty of the secretary of state’s office is administering elections, handling campaign finance reports and enforcing reporting deadlines for contribution and expenditure reports. The secretary of state also registers corporations and limited liability companies and represents the third highest ranking state official behind the governor and lieutenant governor. Marchant’s campaign did not immediately respond to an email request for comment Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office declined to comment. Campaign reporting deadlines normally fall on the 15th of the month for April, July, October and January. But since it fell on a Saturday this month, the deadline was moved to Monday at 5 p.m. Marchant had not filed by late afternoon Tuesday. If the report is filed one to seven days late, the candidate must pay a $25 daily fee. For eight to 15 days late, the penalty is $50 a day. And if the report is filed more than 15 days late, it is $100 a day the up to a maximum of $10,000. Marchant is among the America First Secretary of State Coalition candidates who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election and vow to scrap early voting and vote-counting tabulators.
New Hampshire
Londonderry: The publisher of a weekly newspaper has waived her arraignment, pleading not guilty to charges that she published advertisements for local races without properly marking them as political advertising, the state attorney general’s office said. The six misdemeanor charges allege that Debra Paul, publisher of The Londonderry Times, failed to identify the ads with “appropriate language” indicating that they were ads and saying who paid for them as required by state law, the attorney general’s office said in August after reviewing cases that go back to 2019. Paul, who’s also a member of the town council in Londonderry, said in a statement at the time, “This is clearly a case of a small business needing to defend itself against overreaching government.” A police affidavit said altogether, nearly 60 violations in the Times and a related publication were counted between 2020 and this year. Paul, who along with her husband are the only two employees at the paper, said she originally believed the state’s complaint involved advertising rates, the affidavit said. Her attorney did not return a message seeking comment.
New Jersey
Madison: A former federal prosecutor-turned-producer and a media production company who used Drew University as their backdrop to film a movie about a prestigious college littered with hazing and prejudice is being sued by the school, who claims they filmed and dashed without paying their bill. Executive producer Traci Bransford and her production company Meadowcrest Films and Think Global Media, a company with studios across the nation, used the Morris County private school earlier this year to film “The Choices We Make.” But when it was time to remit payment of over $130,000, Bransford apparently had plenty of excuses why the money was being delayed, according to the lawsuit filed in state Superior Court in Morris County earlier this month. The university names Think Global Media owner Nathan Scinto in the suit due to his partnership with Bransford, but Scinto’s attorney Richard Roth said Tuesday it was “aggressive lawyering” and that there is “absolutely no basis” to go after his client or his company. The facilities and services agreement, which Roth said he obtained, was with Meadowcrest Films. Roth said he plans to file a motion to remove his client from the suit if the university’s attorney does not agree to remove him prior. He also noted that he does not believe there is jurisdiction in New Jersey since his client’s company is not connected to the state. A number listed for Bransford was disconnected and there was no response to an email request for comment. No attorney is listed for her.
New Mexico
Winston: Environmentalists are pushing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to do more to protect Mexican gray wolves after one of the endangered predators was found dead in southwestern New Mexico. The Western Watersheds Project is among the groups that have been critical of the agency’s management of wolves in New Mexico and Arizona, saying illegal killings continue to hamper the population. However, the Fish and Wildlife Service says there have been fewer wolves found dead this year than in previous years. The agency also pointed to a revised recovery plan for the wolf that was released in early October. The agency was under a court order to revamp the plan to address the threat of human-caused mortality as one of the ways to increase survivability for wolves in the wild. Federal officials said they could not provide any details about the circumstances of the latest death since it was an ongoing investigation. It’s rare that such investigations are ever closed. Environmentalists described the male wolf recently found dead near Winston as one of the most genetically-valuable Mexican wolves in the wild. It had been released in 2018 after being born in captivity and then cross-fostered into a wild wolf den as part of an effort to increase genetic diversity.
New York
Miller Place: Authorities rescued nearly 300 rabbits, birds and other animals from a filthy home and charged a self-help book author with cruel confinement of animals, prosecutors announced. “Operation Open Cage” started Oct. 1 when investigators were contacted by animal control officers who reported a hoarding situation in the hamlet of Miller Place on Long Island, the Suffolk County district attorney’s office said. Officers wearing hazardous material suits found a total of 118 rabbits, 150 birds, 15 cats, seven tortoises, three snakes and several mice living among filth, many surrounded by their own feces and urine and covered with cockroaches, the district attorney said. The owner of the home, Karin Keyes, 51, was charged with multiple counts of cruel confinement of animals. She’s a social worker and the author of a self-published book titled “Journey Into Awareness: Reclaiming Your Life.” Information on Keyes’ attorney wasn’t available. A phone message was left at a number listed for her. Teams from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals helped the district attorney’s Biological, Environmental and Animal Safety Team and local officers in removing and transporting the animals to animal welfare organizations around New York for medical care.
North Carolina
Raleigh: Democratic legislators pleaded with the General Assembly’s Republican majority on Tuesday to consider gun safety and mental health measures, citing last week’s shootings in Raleigh that left five people dead. Democratic lawmakers, one a resident of the east Raleigh subdivision where the shooting rampage began last Thursday, said the public expects elected officials to work together to pass laws designed to make them safer. “This is an issue that transcends party. It’s an issue about our safety, the safety of our children, the safety of our state,” Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue said at a news conference. Blue has lived in the Hedingham community where the shootings occurred for over 30 years “and never felt that I would be unsafe in the community where we raised our kids until last week.” Previous Democratic requests for Republicans to permit debate and votes on gun-control measures and others to keep weapons out of the hands of people at extreme risk of becoming violent have been unsuccessful. “My question today is now the time for a discussion of gun reform, or do we have to wait yet for another mass shooting?” said Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Wake County Democrat. House Speaker Tim Moore, a Cleveland County Republican, said in a statement later Tuesday that lawmakers for now “should remain focused on praying for the victims’ families and supporting law enforcement rather than seizing the moment for a political debate.” “We need to allow law enforcement to complete their investigation before jumping to any conclusions about policy changes,” Moore added.
North Dakota
Bismarck: The state health department stored thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses at incorrect temperatures or without temperature data over the past two years, according to a state audit Tuesday that said some of the vaccine was administered to patients. The health department disputed the findings. Tim Wiedrich, who heads the agency’s virus response, said “no non-viable vaccine” was given to patients. In responses that accompanied the audit, the department said clerical errors or other errors of documentation erroneously suggested that expired or bad doses were given. “DoH uses redundant systems to ensure proper monitoring and distribution of vaccines prior to end of shelf life,” the agency said. A spokeswoman for the auditor’s office said it wasn’t recommending revaccinations. “We simply report on what we found,” auditor’s office spokeswoman Emily Dalzell said. “It would be up to the individual and their doctor to decide if revaccination is needed.” The state analysis said nearly 2,000 Moderna doses were stored at incorrect temperatures and were administered to patients. The audit also found that nearly 13,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccines were issued from storage with missing temperature data. The audit covered a two-year span that ended June 30. An inventory of the vaccines was conducted on Aug. 8, 2021, the audit said.
Ohio
Cleveland: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday removed from the bench a Cleveland municipal judge for misconduct and conducting court business “in a manner befitting a game show host,” investigators said. Judge Pinkey S. Carr was indefinitely suspended, and she agreed to undergo evaluations for her mental and physical health. The court said that Carr’s bench was littered with junk, dolls, cups and novelty items - her own attorney described it as “resembling a flea market.” She wore tank tops, T-shirts, spandex shorts and sneakers to court. And she discussed with staff and defendants a television show called “P-Valley” about a fictional Mississippi strip club. Carr joked about accepting kickbacks for lenient sentences if defendants gave her food, beverages, carpeting or storage space. She referred to her bailiff as “Miss Puddin from P-Valley.” In addition to a lack of decorum, Carr was found to have violated a long list of other rules.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday set a statewide election for March 7 for voters to decide whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, a question Democrats had hoped would be on the November ballot to help energize liberal voters. Oklahomans for Sensible Marijuana Laws gathered enough signatures to qualify the question for a statewide vote and thought the proposal would be on the ballot in November. But because it took longer than usual to count the signatures and for courts to consider legal challenges, there wasn’t enough time to print the ballots ahead of the November election. If approved by voters, the question would legalize the use of marijuana for any adult over the age of 21. Marijuana sales would be subjected to a 15% excise tax on top of the standard sales tax, and the revenue it generates would be used to help fund local municipalities, the court system, public schools, substance abuse treatment and the state’s general revenue fund. The proposal also outlines a judicial process for people to seek expungement or dismissal of prior marijuana-related convictions. Oklahoma already has one of the most robust medical marijuana programs in the country, with roughly 10% of the state’s residents having state-issued medical cards that allow them to purchase, grow and consume marijuana. Stitt said that while he supports the federal legalization of marijuana, he opposes the state question, saying the country’s patchwork of state laws on marijuana has become problematic.
Oregon
Salem: State Supreme Court Chief Justice Martha Walters said she’ll retire at the end of the year. Walters, who became the first woman to serve as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2018, is the second justice this month to announce a retirement, giving Democrat Gov. Kate Brown two appointments to the state’s high court before she leaves office, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. “I have loved the job of advocating for our courts and the critical need for access to the services we provide,” Walters said during remarks at a judicial conference where she made the announcement. Walters’ plan to retire comes amid an uncertain political future for the state because of the November gubernatorial election. With unaffiliated candidate Betsy Johnson likely to draw votes, polls have indicated that Republican candidate Christine Drazan and Democratic Tina Kotek are locked in a tight race. By retiring, Walters has ensured Brown will name a replacement who is likely to be aligned with Walters’ jurisprudence.
Pennsylvania
Pittsburgh: Newsroom workers at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette have gone on strike demanding that the company reinstate the terms of its previous contract and return to the bargaining table. The Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh said its members began picketing Tuesday outside the newsroom on the city’s North Shore and planned to continue the action Wednesday. Guild members have been working without a contract since 2017 and Monday voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike against the company. On Oct. 6, workers from unions that are responsible for production, distribution and advertising at the Post-Gazette walked off the job. The Post-Gazette said in a statement that it would “continue to serve the Pittsburgh community, our readers and advertisers, despite any work stoppage.” Officials said they were confident the company would prevail when the National Labor Relations Board rules on the unfair labor practice accusation. The walkout is the first major newspaper strike in the city in three decades. In 1992, WESA reports, about 600 members of a Teamsters local representing truck drivers and circulation route managers went on strike against the Pittsburgh Press, which ended up being sold and merged with the Post-Gazette.
Rhode Island
North Kingstown: An orphaned bobcat found in the kitchen of a Glocester camp will soon return to the wild, said Arianna Mouradjian, director of operations at the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island, in North Kingstown. With an increase in the bobcat population in the state over the last two decades, the Saunderstown clinic has in recent years received several bobcats in need of its rehabilitative services, Mouradjian said. Still, she said, “Bobcats are one of those species we don’t see a lot of.” The most recent guest was rescued July 23 from Aldersgate Camp and Retreat Center in Glocester at about six weeks old. Bobcat kittens typically stay with their mothers 9 to 12 months. Through the end of summer and beginning of fall, she has lived in her own outdoor pen as the clinic staff give her time to grow big enough to fend for herself in the wild.
South Carolina
Greer: BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start building electric vehicles and an additional $700million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement Wednesday reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years. In addition, BMW said it has signed a deal with Envision AESC of Japan to supply battery cells for a new class of at least six electric SUVs that will be built at BMW’s plant in Greer by 2030. Envision will build its new factory at an unspecified site in South Carolina. The companies wouldn’t say how many people will be hired. But the number of jobs could be significant: Battery cell plants being built by other companies will employ between 1,100 and 2,200 workers.
South Dakota
Sioux Falls: A monkey with the Great Plains Zoo is recovering after facing recent surgery because of an injury sustained after the animal picked up a bottle cap someone threw in its enclosure. Kai, the Japanese macaque, had surgery Tuesday, according to a social media post by the zoo. He picked up a bottle top that had been tossed into the snow monkey exhibit, and tucked it into his cheek pouch. Eventually, the bottle cap wore its way through the cheek and needed to be removed. Despite the carefulness of the zoo’s veterinary team, he will have a scar, according to the post. The zoo posted details’s about Kai’s experience as a PSA for visitors to avoid future incidents. Objects the animal care team place in exhibits as enrichment are chosen with species-specific requirements in mind, according to the post. The zoo asked visitors if they drop something in by mistake, tell a zoo employee immediately.
Tennessee
Nashville:  Early voting kicked off Wednesday for the November midterm general election. The 14-day period of voting ahead of the Nov. 8 Election Day runs Mondays through Saturdays until Thursday, Nov. 3. The ballot features Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s reelection bid against Democrat Jason Martin, four constitutional amendments, U.S. House contests and state legislative races. Additionally, Tennessee’s deadline to request an absentee ballot to vote by mail is Nov. 1. Those ballots must be returned by mail in time for the county election commission to receive it no later than the close of polls on Election Day. The deadline to register to vote in the general election has passed. Voters can get more info at GoVoteTN.gov. Tennessee heads into the election with 4.55 million registered voters, an increase of about 127,800 since December 2021, according to the Tennessee secretary of state’s office.
Texas
Robstown:Former President Donald Trump plans a rally in what is shaping up as competitive South Texas on Saturday, just two days before the start of early voting ahead of the Nov. 8 elections. Trump, who in May was in Houston for a gathering of the National Rifle Association and two weeks earlier was in Austin as part of his “Save America Tour,” will be at the Richard M. Borchard Regional Fairgrounds in Robstown, about 20 miles west of Corpus Christi. In an advisory, Trump said he wants to “energize voters” by reminding them of the number of Republican candidates he has endorsed who have gone on to win elections, or at least their GOP primaries. During the March primaries, Trump endorsed Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, all of whom face competitive races from Democrats this cycle.
Utah
Zion National Park: Thirty-three immigrants gathered beneath Zion’s iconic 1,000-foot sandstone cliffs for the park’s first-ever naturalization ceremony on Tuesday. It was an unusual setting for a ceremony typically confined to courtrooms or office space run by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service in Salt Lake City. For residents of southwestern Utah, the locale meant they could avoid the four-hour trip north. “I’m so grateful for this moment, for my family,” said St. George resident Brenda Corsi, originally from Huacho, Peru. “I know that we have an amazing future.”
Vermont
Montpelier: The Vermont Supreme Court has rejected a request for bail from a man considered a person of interest in the shooting deaths of a couple in Concord, New Hampshire. In its Tuesday decision, the court unanimously rejected an appeal filed by attorneys for Logan Clegg, who was arrested last week in Vermont as a fugitive from justice from Utah. Clegg’s attorneys had argued he could not be held without bail prior to trial because the charge he is facing does not carry a potential sentence of life in prison. But the Vermont Supreme Court rejected that argument, saying that under Vermont law Clegg is not being held prior to trial, but as a fugitive from justice. When Clegg, 26, and homeless, was arrested by local police after being spotted detectives from Concord, South Burlington described him as a person of interest in an unsolved April homicide in Concord. The New Hampshire Attorney General’s office said police made contact in Vermont with a person of interest the April killings of Stephen and Djeswende Reid, but they didn’t name the person. No arrests have been made or charges filed in the killings. Clegg’s arrest on a fugitive from justice charge included a probation violation.
Virginia
Waynesboro: Police arrested a man over the weekend, charging him with attempted murder in Waynesboro, a press release said. Gage W. Mayne, 26, no fixed address, is facing charges of attempted second-degree murder, use of a firearm while attempting to commit murder, aggravated malicious wounding and four counts of obstruction of justice, the Waynesboro Police Department said. On Sunday morning shortly after midnight, Waynesboro officers responded to an address in the 2500 block of Village Drive. When police arrived, they encountered a 27-year-old man with what appeared to be a gunshot wound, the release said. During a preliminary investigation, officers identified Mayne as a suspect. He had already fled the scene in a vehicle. The vehicle Mayne was reportedly driving was found on the northeast side of Waynesboro. Police said Mayne was inside. He was placed into police custody without incident. Mayne is being held without bond at Middle River Regional Jail.
Washington
Seattle: The air quality west of the Cascades has deteriorated again as wildfires continue to burn. The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency sent out an alert Tuesday afternoon saying the smoke around Seattle was causing unhealthy air and that people should close windows and limit time outdoors. Other areas around Puget Sound were experiencing air considered unhealthy for sensitive groups or worse, the agency said. The smoke-laden air gave the Pacific Northwest the designation of worst air quality in the U.S. on Tuesday, KGW Meteorologist Joe Raineri said. Nine fires were burning in Washington and Oregon before a red flag warning for critical fire conditions was issued over the weekend. Some new fires started while the Nakia Creek Fire in southwest Washington took off, causing much of the smoky air seen around southwest Washington and Portland, officials said. In the Pacific Northwest, relief should come Friday. “Friday through Saturday will be cooler and more seasonable and we’ll finally get that rain. I think everyone’s excited about that,” National Weather Service meteorologist Kayla Mazurkiewicz told The Seattle Times. “We should have had a couple of inches by now.”
West Virginia
Huntington: A man has been charged in a woman’s 1993 slaying in the state, police said. Ricky Louie Woody, 59, of Billings, Montana, was charged earlier this month in the March 1993 death of Melissa Martinez in Huntington. She had a gunshot wound to the torso, lacerations to the head and died at a hospital, police said in a news release Tuesday. Witnesses initially provided information that led detectives to Woody, but there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Woody moved from Huntington to Billings within a year of Martinez’s death, the statement said. Billings detectives contacted Huntington police in May 2021 and indicated Woody told them he knew the person responsible for killing a woman known to him as “Lisa” in the early 1990s. Woody ultimately admitted he participated in her death, the statement said. Huntington detectives determined Woody was referring to the death of Martinez and interviewed him in September 2021 at a Billings jail, leading to the charges. Woody has waived extradition and will be returned to Huntington upon the resolution of the case in Montana, police said.
Wisconsin
Ashland County: A man whose 5-year-old daughter and her mother were killed in a car crash involving the state Senate’s minority leader has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the lawmaker. Brandon Fink, whose daughter Khaleesi Fink and the girl’s mother, Alyssa Ortman, were killed in the July crash, filed the lawsuit Friday in Ashland County (Wisconsin) Circuit Court, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Court documents show that the family lived in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, names Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley, another driver and three insurance companies as defendants. Bewley, who represents a state Senate district that covers northwestern Wisconsin, pulled out of a Lake Superior beach entrance in Ashland on July 22 and into the path of a car driven by Ortman, according to police. When Ortman’s car collided with Bewley’s, it spun across Highway 2 and was hit by a vehicle driven by Jodi Munson, 45, of Washburn. Ortman’s 5-year-old daughter was pronounced dead at the crash scene. Ortman later died at a hospital, according to police. The Ashland police report, obtained by The Associated Press, says Bewley was distracted by her hands-free mobile phone at the time of the crash. The lawsuit alleges that all three drivers acted negligently. Bewley’s spokesperson, Joey Huey, said the state senator would have no comment.
Wyoming
Cody: A college wrestler helped his teammate survive a grizzly mauling over the weekend by trying to wrestle the massive bear off his friend, eventually drawing a more brutal attack to himself. The men are crediting their bonds as wrestling teammates at Northwest College in Cody, Wyoming, with helping them survive the attack Saturday evening southeast of Yellowstone National Park. Brady Lowry of Cedar City, Utah, suffered a broken arm and puncture wounds in the initial attack after they surprised the bear while searching for antlers shed by elk and deer in the Shoshone National Forest. “It shook me around and I didn’t know what to do,” Lowry told KSL-TV Monday in an interview from a hospital in Billings, Montana. “I curled up in a ball and it got me a few more times.” His teammate – Kendell Cummings of Evanston, Wyoming – tried to stop the attack on Lowry by yelling, kicking and hitting the bear and pulling on its fur. Wyoming wildlife officials said they will not try to capture and relocate or kill the bear because it was a surprise attack and because there are many other bears in the area, making it difficult for them to determine which bear was involved.

THE INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES DURING THE 2022 JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI FLOODS POINT TO A LARGER ISSUE

(TNSres) -- Earth Day Network posted the following news on Oct. 19, 2022:
Heavy rains in late August 2022 resulted in the cresting of the Pearl River, causing flood waters to spill into the surrounding suburbs of Jackson, Mississippi. The flooding resulted in the disruption of water treatment systems, leaving tens of thousands in Bolivar and Hinds Counties under a boil water notice for weeks afterwards.
The communities surrounding the capital region of Mississippi are no strangers to flooding and potable water issues. A similar event occurred on the Pearl River in February 2020, where water treatment pumps failed to alleviate the flood waters. Many locals remember the 1979 Easter Flood where intense rainfall and flooding of the Pearl River caused over $1 billion in damages in today's dollars around the Jackson area.
Situated within a river delta, the low-lying and permeable delta soils make the region extremely susceptible to subsidence (the sinking of land) and flooding. Its proximity to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and its annual hurricane season make the region sensitive to the slightest changes in climate.
Mississippi's Department of Environmental Quality's Delta Sustainable Water Resources Task Force was created in 2014 to oversee sustainable water usage, but recent failures and irregularities in enforcement have put its effectiveness into question. The flooding in late August was exacerbated by equipment failures at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant, leaving much of Hinds County without safe drinking water. With proper upkeep of municipal infrastructure, it is likely that breakdowns like this can be preventable.
The lack of funding for critical municipal services is a systemic issue decades in the making. Protests for equitable distribution of federal funds for Black neighborhoods in 1970 succeeded, but have since rarely been achieved. With Bolivar and Hinds Counties' populations majority Black, the lack of funding for these counties' infrastructure compared to the wealthier and majority white Madison County is notable.
The failure to properly upkeep vital infrastructure in a county where nearly 26% of its population is in poverty is an indicator of which communities will face the front lines of the damages of climate change going forward. As climate change makes severe weather events more intense, the Mississippi Delta Region will continue to see more flooding events. If infrastructure for these vulnerable communities is not properly funded, we will continue to see similar municipal injustices over and over again.
EARTHDAY.ORG's campaign Invest in our Planet encourages our partners and communities to take steps to ensure we leave to future generations a planet worth inhabiting. Investing from the bottom up by ensuring stable infrastructure for those most vulnerable to climate change must be a priority. Access to safe drinking water, especially in times of severe weather, is a necessity if communities on the front line of climate change are to survive.
Suffering caused by severe weather events will only be exacerbated by deteriorated infrastructure in the Mississippi Delta Region. Proper funding for upkeep and improvements to existing infrastructure is a necessary first step towards public safety and trust in the system.

EPA civil rights case targets Mississippi over Jackson water

JACKSON, Miss. — The federal government is investigating whether Mississippi state agencies discriminated against the state's majority-Black capital city by refusing to fund improvements for its failing water system, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.
The announcement came days after leaders of two congressional committees said they were starting a joint investigation into a crisis that left most homes and businesses in Jackson without running water for several days in late August and early September.
The EPA gave The Associated Press the first confirmation that it is conducting a civil, not criminal, investigation of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Mississippi State Department of Health. The federal agency could withhold money from the state if it finds wrongdoing — potentially millions of dollars. If the state agencies don’t cooperate with the investigation, the EPA could refer the case to the Department of Justice.
Heavy rainfall in late August exacerbated problems at Jackson's main water treatment facility. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves declared an emergency Aug. 29, and the state health department and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency have been overseeing operations and repairs at the facility since then.
About 80% of Jackson’s 150,000 residents are Black, and about a quarter of the population lives in poverty. By the time Reeves issued the emergency order, Jackson residents had already been told for a month to boil their water to kill possible contaminants. Volunteers and the National Guard had distributed millions of bottles of drinking water. Although the boil-water notice was lifted in mid-September, many residents remain skeptical about water safety.
NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who lives in Jackson with his family, called the EPA investigation a step in the right direction after years of the state withholding federal funds to improve the city’s water system.
“We believe we gave compelling evidence that the state of Mississippi intentionally starved the city of Jackson of the resources to maintain its water infrastructure,” Johnson told The AP on Thursday. “We want the EPA and this administration to put forth a course of action to prevent the state of Mississippi from ever doing this again.”
Johnson was named among several residents in the NAACP’s civil rights complaint against Mississippi. He said the state’s inaction and record of divestment in Jackson amounts to “systemic neglect.”
“We believe that all citizens of this country should be entitled to clean, fresh drinking water,” Johnson said. “Unfortunately, we live in a state that is still dealing in racial politics. And as a result of that, you have state leaders who seek to penalize African American residents of the city of Jackson in a very discriminatory way.”
The AP reported in September that years before Reeves became governor, he touted his own track record of fiscal conservatism by citing his opposition to spending state money for Jackson's crumbling water and sewer infrastructure. The EPA is not investigating Reeves.
Reeves said Thursday that the state took control of Jackson’s water system because of “absolute and total incompetence” of the city's Democratic mayor and administration. The governor’s latest remarks are an escalation of a dispute between him and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba over whether the state or the city will decide on a private firm to operate Jackson’s water system.
“They have proven that they have no ability to manage the water system,” Reeves told reporters during an event at the Governor’s Mansion, according to a video of the event by WLBT-TV.
A city spokeswoman said Lumumba would not respond to the governor's statements.
In a federal complaint Sept. 27, the NAACP said Mississippi officials “all but assured” a drinking water calamity by depriving Jackson of badly needed funds to upgrade its infrastructure. The organization asked the EPA to investigate the state’s alleged pattern of steering money to majority-white communities with less need.
The group said the state’s refusal to fund improvements in Jackson culminated in the near-total collapse of the water system in late August. Over 25 years, Jackson received funds from an important federal program only three times, the NAACP said. When Jackson tried to fund improvements itself, those efforts were repeatedly blocked by state political leaders, according to the complaint.
The NAACP wants the EPA to make sure that from now on, federal funds are distributed equitably.
Reeves said Thursday that the state has bought chemicals and hired workers for the water plant since he declared the emergency, after the city failed to do both of those things.
The NAACP filed its complaint under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids recipients of federal funds from discriminating based on race or national origin. While previously the law was rarely used to pursue environmental matters, the Biden administration has increased its enforcement efforts in communities overburdened by pollution.
Recently, the EPA said it had preliminary evidence that Louisiana officials allowed air pollution to remain high and downplayed the threat to Black residents who live in the industrial section of the state commonly referred to as cancer alley. The agency has also opened up an investigation into Colorado’s air permitting program and into state and local officials in Alabama over chronic wastewater problems in majority-Black Lowndes County.

100M HEADED TO DETROIT TO REPLACE LEAD SERVICE LINES OVER NEXT THREE YEARS; MORE FUNDING ON THE WAY
States News Service

The following information was released by the City of Detroit:
POSTED BY Water and Sewerage Department
$100M headed to Detroit to replace lead service lines over next three years; more funding on the way
DWSD to accelerate existing lead service line replacement program that began in 2018
Funding will allow for at least 5,000 lead lines to be replaced annually
Contractor equity and capacity building in progress
DETROIT - Thanks to recently awarded state and federal grants, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) now has amassed a $100 million fund that will allow it to dramatically speed up the replacement of its estimated 80,000 lead services lines in the city at no additional cost to its customers, DWSD Director Gary Brown announced today.
Lead service lines are what carry treated water from the public water main to the house. The Michigan Lead and Copper Rule, the most stringent in America, requires all lead service lines to be replaced over the next 20 years. Detroit houses built before 1945 likely have a lead service line unless the pipe was replaced in recent years.
"Annual testing shows the water leaving the treatment plants is well within state and federal safety guidelines," Brown said. "While there is no evidence to suggest lead service lines are a contributor to elevated blood lead levels in Detroit, they do pose a risk. As part of DWSD's commitment to safe drinking water, we will eventually replace all residential lead service lines in our city."
Brown said that the influx of funding means DWSD will be able to ramp up its current program from 700 replacements per year to at least 5,000. Currently DWSD replaces lead service lines while on the same street replacing the water main. The additional funding will enable the utility to replace individual service lines outside of DWSD's capital improvement program.
The cost of residential lead service line replacement, which requires excavation at the curbstop valve and uses the boring method to install the new line to the home, can be more than $10,000 per house due to inflation. The $100 million fund is expected to be able to replace service lines at a rate of about 5,000 per year over the next three years. Brown said DWSD will use predictive modeling, confirmed service line data, and residents who place their home on the wait list to cluster replacements by council district to make efficient use of the dollars.
The $100M for Detroit's Lead Service Line Replacement Program is as follows:
$75M American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds through Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE)
$10M Michigan Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (DWSRF)
$5M Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WIIN grant
$10M DWSD Capital Improvement Program
Brown said that much more revenue will be needed to replace all the estimated 80,000 lead service lines in Detroit and his staff is currently pursuing additional funding sources.
"With an existing and robust lead service line replacement program, we have the ability to dramatically accelerate our work based with this new funding," said Gary Brown, DWSD director. "We thank our federal and state partners for providing the bulk of the funding. We've said for the past four years, we cannot put the cost on the backs of our ratepayers outside funding is essential to replace the lines."
While on the street replacing the water main, DWSD has 100% compliance with residents or adult occupants allowing it to replace the full lead service line since access to the home is required. This is largely due to a comprehensive community outreach effort that begins at least 40 days in advance of construction.
How it works - Detroit's Lead Service Line Replacement Program
In 2018, prior to the revised Michigan Lead and Copper Rule, DWSD began replacing lead service lines as part of its capital improvement program when on the same street replacing the water main. Extensive outreach, including neighborhood meetings and information packets, to the owner/occupant is done prior to construction.
The city is responsible for the existing portion of the service line from the public water main to the curbstop (turn-on/off valve typically in the front yard). The property owner is responsible for the service line from the curbstop to inside the house. Prior to a service line replacement, contractors excavate the curbstop to visually verify the pipe material. Lead and galvanized pipes are replaced with copper.
When a lead service line is verified, DWSD gets owner or adult occupant permission (including tenant) to replace the full lead service line, including the private portion and get access to connect it to the home plumbing through the water meter. DWSD warranties the work for one year before the property owner resumes ownership of their portion. Under this program, there is no cost to the property owner to have the pipe replaced.
Addressing contractor capacity and equity
To increase contractor capacity and equity, and utilize the $100 million for lead service line replacement, DWSD has been actively engaging with potential contractors across the city, state and even surrounding states to support this goal. And, the department will continue to ensure contractors comply with Mayor Duggan's Executive Order on 51% of the hours worked need to be Detroit residents.
DWSD's Opportunity and Inclusion Director Tiffany Jones looked at contractors that have already completed work on similar programs, including Benton Harbor, Eastpointe, and the City of Detroit Basement Backup Protection Program. So far, she organized 10 meetings, representing 28 organizations. The meetings provide an overview, including the procurement process, and allow the opportunity for contractors to ask questions.
DWSD has committed to breaking up the bids in various amounts to allow for smaller contractors to be the primary bidder.
Extensive community outreach
A nine-page information packet with a folder was created specific to the Detroit lead service line replacement program that has a notice, frequently asked questions, flushing information and homeowner/occupant agreement to authorize replacement of the private portion of the lead service line. Extensive community outreach and education are done to ensure residents are aware of the program and know the process from start to finish. The packets are hand delivered to the house, not mailed.
Community meetings in advance of construction are held in a nearby median, vacant lot, church, or virtually.
A pitcher filter and cartridge are also delivered to all houses on the street of the water main replacement as a precautionary measure, and for individual lead service line replacement. This action was initiated in 2017 after the Flint water crisis. Pitcher filters were chosen since homes have different faucet fixtures. The filters are the type that are designed for lead reduction.
The facts about lead in drinking water
The water leaving Detroit water treatment plants, operated by the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), does not contain lead, but lead can be released into drinking water from lead service lines and home plumbing as the water moves from the water mains to your tap. Beginning in 1945, Detroit stopped allowing the installation of lead piping for water service lines. Homes before 1945 are most likely to have a lead pipe that connects the home to the water main, known as a lead service line. The lead in lead service lines, household plumbing and fixtures can dissolve or break off into water and end up in tap water. The water provided to DWSD customers contains a corrosion inhibitor to reduce leaching from lead service lines and other lead components, but lead can still be present in water at the tap.
"We know that the number one source of lead poisoning in children is decaying paint and dust in homes that were constructed prior to 1978," said Chief Public Health Officer Denise Fair Razo." The Detroit Health Department can help, with education on how to reduce lead exposure in homes, and referrals to get children tested. If anyone has any concerns regarding lead exposure inside their home, I encourage you to request a lead test from your child's primary healthcare provider or contact the Detroit Health Department."
Steps to reduce exposure to lead in your water
Run your water to flush out lead. The more time water has been sitting in your home's pipes, the more lead it may contain. Therefore, if your water has not been used for several hours, run the water before using it for drinking or cooking. This flushes lead-containing water from the pipes. If you do not have a lead service line, run the water for 30 seconds to two minutes, or until it becomes cold or reaches a steady temperature. If you do have a lead service line, run the water for at least five minutes to flush water from both the interior building plumbing and the lead service line.
Use only cold water for drinking and cooking. Do not cook with or drink water from the hot water tap; lead dissolves more easily into hot water.
Use only filtered water or bottled water for preparing baby formula.
Do not boil water to remove lead. Boiling water will not reduce lead levels. In the event DWSD issues a boil water advisory due to low water pressure (such as caused by a large water main break), water users in the designated advisory area will be advised to boil water before using for cooking, drinking and brushing your teeth. Residents with lead service lines should only boil filtered water not water directly from the tap.
Consider using a filter to reduce lead in drinking water. The Detroit Health Department recommends that any household with a child or pregnant woman use a certified lead filter to reduce lead from their drinking water. Look for filters that are tested and certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 53 for lead reduction.
Some filter options include a pour-through pitcher or faucet-mount systems. If the label does not specifically mention lead reduction, check the Performance Data Sheet included with the device. Be sure to maintain and replace the filter device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to protect water quality.
Get your child tested. Contact the Detroit Health Department at 313-876-0133 or your healthcare provider to find out how you can get your child tested for lead if you are concerned about exposure.
Identify older plumbing fixtures that likely contain lead. Older faucets, fittings, and valves sold before 2014 may contain higher levels of lead, even if marked "lead-free." Faucets, fittings, and valves sold after January 2014 are required to meet a more restrictive "lead-free" definition but may still contain up to 0.25 percent lead. When purchasing new plumbing materials, it is important to look for materials that are certified to meet NSF standard 61.
Clean your aerator. The aerator on the end of your faucet is a screen that will catch debris. This debris could include particulate lead. The aerator should be removed monthly to rinse out any debris.

DETROIT, Mich., Oct. 20 -- The city of Detroit issued the following news release:
$100M headed to Detroit to replace lead service lines over next three years; more funding on the way
* DWSD to accelerate existing lead service line replacement program that began in 2018
* Funding will allow for at least 5,000 lead lines to be replaced annually
* Contractor equity and capacity building in progress
DETROIT -Thanks to recently awarded state and federal grants, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) now has amassed a $100 million fund that will allow it to dramatically speed up the replacement of its estimated 80,000 lead services lines in the city - at no additional cost to its customers, DWSD Director Gary Brown announced today.
Lead service lines are what carry treated water from the public water main to the house. The Michigan Lead & Copper Rule, the most stringent in America, requires all lead service lines to be replaced over the next 20 years. Detroit houses built before 1945 likely have a lead service line unless the pipe was replaced in recent years.
"Annual testing shows the water leaving the treatment plants is well within state and federal safety guidelines," Brown said. "While there is no evidence to suggest lead service lines are a contributor to elevated blood lead levels in Detroit, they do pose a risk. As part of DWSD's commitment to safe drinking water, we will eventually replace all residential lead service lines in our city."
Brown said that the influx of funding means DWSD will be able to ramp up its current program from 700 replacements per year to at least 5,000. Currently DWSD replaces lead service lines while on the same street replacing the water main. The additional funding will enable the utility to replace individual service lines outside of DWSD's capital improvement program.
The cost of residential lead service line replacement, which requires excavation at the curbstop valve and uses the boring method to install the new line to the home, can be more than $10,000 per house due to inflation. The $100 million fund is expected to be able to replace service lines at a rate of about 5,000 per year over the next three years. Brown said DWSD will use predictive modeling, confirmed service line data, and residents who place their home on the wait list to cluster replacements by council district to make efficient use of the dollars.
The $100M for Detroit's Lead Service Line Replacement Program is as follows:
* $75M American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds through Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE)
* $10M Michigan Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (DWSRF)
* $5M Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WIIN grant
* $10M DWSD Capital Improvement Program
Brown said that much more revenue will be needed to replace all the estimated 80,000 lead service lines in Detroit and his staff is currently pursuing additional funding sources.
"With an existing and robust lead service line replacement program, we have the ability to dramatically accelerate our work based with this new funding," said Gary Brown, DWSD director. "We thank our federal and state partners for providing the bulk of the funding. We've said for the past four years, we cannot put the cost on the backs of our ratepayers - outside funding is essential to replace the lines."
While on the street replacing the water main, DWSD has 100% compliance with residents or adult occupants allowing it to replace the full lead service line since access to the home is required. This is largely due to a comprehensive community outreach effort that begins at least 40 days in advance of construction.

DWSD has footage from a press confererence with EGLE announcing the funding as well as talking about and showing the lead service line replacement program in Detroit:https://dwsd.box.com/s/dd2npentkj222u59pu638m1qwc4cg19b. Photos are also available.
How it works - Detroit's Lead Service Line Replacement Program
In 2018, prior to the revised Michigan Lead and Copper Rule, DWSD began replacing lead service lines as part of its capital improvement program when on the same street replacing the water main. Extensive outreach, including neighborhood meetings and information packets, to the owner/occupant is done prior to construction.
The city is responsible for the existing portion of the service line from the public water main to the curbstop (turn-on/off valve typically in the front yard). The property owner is responsible for the service line from the curbstop to inside the house. Prior to a service line replacement, contractors excavate the curbstop to visually verify the pipe material. Lead and galvanized pipes are replaced with copper.
When a lead service line is verified, DWSD gets owner or adult occupant permission (including tenant) to replace the full lead service line, including the private portion and get access to connect it to the home plumbing through the water meter. DWSD warranties the work for one year before the property owner resumes ownership of their portion. Under this program, there is no cost to the property owner to have the pipe replaced.

Residents are encouraged to watch thisvideoto determine if you have a lead service line and put yourself on a wait list for replacement athttps://detroitmi.gov/lslr.
Addressing contractor capacity and equity
To increase contractor capacity and equity, and utilize the $100 million for lead service line replacement, DWSD has been actively engaging with potential contractors across the city, state and even surrounding states to support this goal. And, the department will continue to ensure contractors comply with Mayor Duggan's Executive Order on 51% of the hours worked need to be Detroit residents.
DWSD's Opportunity and Inclusion Director Tiffany Jones looked at contractors that have already completed work on similar programs, including Benton Harbor, Eastpointe, and the City of Detroit Basement Backup Protection Program. So far, she organized 10 meetings, representing 28 organizations. The meetings provide an overview, including the procurement process, and allow the opportunity for contractors to ask questions.
DWSD has committed to breaking up the bids in various amounts to allow for smaller contractors to be the primary bidder. The bids will be posted in the next few weeks onhttps://mitn.info/.
Extensive community outreach
A nine-page information packet with a folder was created specific to the Detroit lead service line replacement program that has a notice, frequently asked questions, flushing information and homeowner/occupant agreement to authorize replacement of the private portion of the lead service line. Extensive community outreach and education are done to ensure residents are aware of the program and know the process from start to finish. The packets are hand delivered to the house, not mailed.
Community meetings in advance of construction are held in a nearby median, vacant lot, church, or virtually.
A pitcher filter and cartridge are also delivered to all houses on the street of the water main replacement as a precautionary measure, and for individual lead service line replacement. This action was initiated in 2017 after the Flint water crisis. Pitcher filters were chosen since homes have different faucet fixtures. The filters are the type that are designed for lead reduction.
The facts about lead in drinking water
The water leaving Detroit water treatment plants, operated by the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), does not contain lead, but lead can be released into drinking water from lead service lines and home plumbing as the water moves from the water mains to your tap. Beginning in 1945, Detroit stopped allowing the installation of lead piping for water service lines. Homes before 1945 are most likely to have a lead pipe that connects the home to the water main, known as a lead service line. The lead in lead service lines, household plumbing and fixtures can dissolve or break off into water and end up in tap water. The water provided to DWSD customers contains a corrosion inhibitor to reduce leaching from lead service lines and other lead components, but lead can still be present in water at the tap.
"We know that the number one source of lead poisoning in children is decaying paint and dust in homes that were constructed prior to 1978," said Chief Public Health Officer Denise Fair Razo." The Detroit Health Department can help, with education on how to reduce lead exposure in homes, and referrals to get children tested. If anyone has any concerns regarding lead exposure inside their home, I encourage you to request a lead test from your child's primary healthcare provider or contact the Detroit Health Department."

Road to climate gains could be a rocky one; Promised progress may come, but some experts see cracks in more ambitious goals

When President Joe Biden signed the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act last November - commonly known as the bipartisan infrastructure bill - he and other proponents noted it would be the largest investment in infrastructure in a generation.
But they also promised it would be something else: a historic effort to tackle climate change. Although it didn't devote hundreds of billions of dollars directly to the climate fight as the Inflation Reduction Act did this year, the administration said the infrastructure bill would help transition the nation to cleaner sources of energy while electrifying the transportation sector and preparing roads and bridges for a changing world.
"President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal passed by Congress will strengthen our nation's resilience to extreme weather and climate change while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expanding access to clean drinking water, building up a clean power grid, and more,"  the White House asserted in November 2021.
Promises were numerous:
Roads and bridges: $110 billion to "repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety."
More public transit: $105 billion for public transit and rail, which would "eliminate the Amtrak maintenance backlog" and otherwise cut  greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by electrifying public transit.
Better grid: $65 billion for "the largest investment in clean energy transmission and the electric grid in American history."
Cleaner water: $15 billion to "replace all of the nation's lead pipes and service lines" and about $35 billion more to further upgrade drinking and wastewater infrastructure.
EV chargers: $7.5 billion to "build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States."
Experts say that as funding from the law begins to roll out, Americans will soon see upgrades like electric school buses, followed by a growing network of electric vehicle charging stations. But they also warn that funding from the bill probably won't result in dramatic changes in the way Americans and electricity move throughout the country, limiting the overall climate impact.
USA TODAY spoke to a variety of climate and transportation experts to look more closely at whether the bill's promises are meeting reality.
Transportation transformation?
Though experts said it's too early to fully judge the bill on its climate merits - spending will primarily be portioned out over five or 10 years - many agreed on two conclusions.
First, the bill is indeed historic in its commitment of money  and focus on climate. Experts said that in most cases the Biden administration is working diligently to ensure a good rollout. Among other measures, the U.S. Department of Transportation is crafting a new regulation to pair about $27 billion in funding with an effort for states to track and lower greenhouse emissions from transportation.
But others say that because of continued prioritization of roads and cars and a lack of accountability at the state level, they don't expect the bill to revolutionize the transportation or energy sectors, which together account for more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
"Most Americans do not have access to transit or certainly not good transit," said Beth Osborne, director of the national nonprofit Transportation for America. "We have a lot of work to do."
Much of the past year was spent simply laying the groundwork for awarding the funding. Money will start to roll out this fall or early next year.
Experts say administration officials have moved swiftly to set funding stipulations that meet many climate and policy groups' wish lists. Most feel the administration is doing about all it can to ensure climate change remains a priority once money is awarded to states and cities, which will actually do the spending.
"There's still a lot to do, but they've made a lot of progress since the law was enacted," said Deron Lovaas, a senior policy  adviser with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.
But experts warn the devil's in the details, and many won't be revealed until further down the line.
Early rollouts, mixed results
Of projects that have had early rollouts, results are mixed.
On one end of the spectrum, cities and schools are clamoring for money for electric school buses, generating a buzz of excitement about a rapid transition in the years ahead.
Money to replace lead service lines sits on the other side of the ledger. Experts have noted that the allocated $15billion doesn't nearly match the actual cost of replacing every lead drinking water pipe across the country.
With the first year of state-by-state funding for lead service line replacements already set in stone,  lawmakers in states like New Jersey are decrying a formula they say unfairly awards more money to some states. Because the formula was based on overall infrastructure needs instead of the number of actual lead service lines, an NRDC analysis found states like Ohio and New Jersey  get only about $100 per lead pipe, while Hawaii receives $10,000.
"It is shocking that the reported plan for the distribution of these funds gives some states thousands of dollars per pipe ... while the most impacted states are left to bear almost the entire cost of replacement themselves," New Jersey state senators Troy Singleton and Linda Greenstein wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The EPA says it is working to fix its funding formula, but the problem points to  a wider truth, experts say: The bill's money is not going to fully address the nation's infrastructure and environmental challenges.
Cars are still king
Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the nonprofit Center for American Progress, noted that the lion's share of the bill's new spending - $110billion - is earmarked for traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges.
That, in itself, can be problematic. For much of the past century, America's spending on transportation has revolved around the automobile, with interstate highway systems feasting as public transportation systems like trains and subways starved. Because cars and trucks emit large quantities of carbon dioxide, that legacy has now made transportation the largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any sector in the U.S. economy.
"So many people are locked into driving, because that's the only thing we built for," DeGood said.
That the bill continues to spend heavily on roadways signals that the automobile still reigns supreme. Further complicating the matter, DeGood said, is that the $110 billion in additional road and bridge funding is largely distributed to 52  state Department of Transportation agencies, including those in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
Those agencies have some flexibility in how they use the money,  including for public transportation. But DeGood says that historically such departments have focused on cars by expanding roadways and building new ones and that there is little to suggest this time will be different.
When state DOT administrators "wake up in the morning," DeGood said, "they think in terms of congestion and road widening."
The first year of boosted road and bridge funding has already rolled out the door, and oversight on how much is actually going to climate-friendly projects is difficult because of the slushiness of state budgets, DeGood said.
Progress on EV charging network
Reliance on the automobile can be less problematic if cars and trucks on the road are running on  electricity.
Max Baumhefner, a senior attorney with the NRDC who watches the electric vehicle space, said there's mostly good news on the effort to build out a  nationwide network of charging stations.
Although he says it will be a year or two before Americans see chargers physically installed, he adds the U.S. Department of Transportation worked swiftly to launch a National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which will divvy up the $5 billion set aside for electric vehicle charging stations.
Just three months after the bill passed, the program released  guidelines for states to apply for the money. Baumhefner approves of the criteria, which he says emphasizes the installation of the latest generation of fast-charging stations located strategically along heavily traveled highways.
"Fast charging is getting a lot faster," Baumhefner said. "We're seeing a move toward charging that gets you back on the road after a cup of coffee and a bathroom break, where before it was more like stopping for lunch."
Another $2.5 billion is earmarked for a separate community grant program that Baumhefner predicts will mostly be used to build out local charging stations. The Inflation Reduction Act passed this summer offers further billions to complement charging station development.
But Baumhefner warns of a downside: Estimates show the U.S. probably will need to spend at least $40 billion on public EV charging stations just to meet its 2030 climate goals. And that doesn't include what it will cost to charge medium- and heavy-duty vehicles like tractor trailers or hit even larger 2050 targets.
"The bottom line is that it's a historic investment, but it's not alone sufficient," Baumhefner said.
Public transit, rail fall short
Osborne, with Transportation for America, says it's a similar story for public transportation and railways.
The bill allocated more money than ever for public transportation, which she says will largely address much-needed maintenance backlogs in cities and towns across the country. Although much of the money has yet to be used, Americans can expect to see lots of minor improvements in the years ahead: faster subways and trolleys as rail lines are repaired, older train cars and buses replaced with nicer new ones, and more frequent service.
Amtrak received a particularly big boost,  a nearly ninefold increase in funding from the last major transportation bill in 2015.
And perhaps the most visible transformation to Americans will be school buses. The infrastructure bill devoted $5 billion to replacing gas-powered school buses nationwide with ones running on electricity or other zero-emission fuels. In September, the EPA announced it was nearly doubling the amount of first-year funding, from $500 to $965 million, after school districts bombarded it with applications.
The agency expects to release  a list of awardees this month.
"We're working across all 50 states to accelerate the transition to a future where clean, zero-emissions school buses are the American standard," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.
But Osborne says there are still a lot of question marks on public transportation. A simple boost in funding isn't enough on its own, she says, noting that federal and state officials still need to build out programs to  use the money. Often, such efforts can get bogged down by politics and special interests.
In one particularly thorny example, Osborne says,  Amtrak wants to upgrade passenger service along the Gulf Coast on railways owned by CSX, a private company. But she says CSX has largely rebuffed the efforts based on cost claims, and the matter is now before a federal review board. How aggressively the administration approaches the dispute could foretell how serious it is about public transit.
"There is a failure to regulate and manage the rail owners according to the law," Osborne said. "The administration has to get that straight."
And even if policies ultimately complement the funding, Osborne says, results are still mitigated by the fact that the car remains king. There's more money than ever for rail and public transit, but the same is true for roads and highways. With the latter still getting about 80% of the pie, Osborne has serious doubts on how far the needle will move in the effort to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
"It's almost entirely status quo," Osborne said. "If we really want to make a big difference on climate and equity ... we need to build tons and tons more public transit."
Long way to go for power grid
Experts say the country also needs to build vast amounts of new high-power transmission lines to support the shift to renewables and cut emissions from the energy sector, the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after transportation.
Rob Gramlich, president of power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies LLC, says such lines are essential to ensuring wind, solar and other green energy sources can travel vast distances to population centers. Demand for renewable energy generation is growing, as it is for electric cars and devices. But transmission lines linking the two are falling far behind.
"What that tells you is this going to be the big issue of the next few years," Gramlich said.
On paper, the infrastructure bill devoted $81 billion to the energy grid and power sector, the second-biggest pot of money after roads and bridges. In promoting the bill, the White House promised "thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy."
But, Gramlich said, the bill provided very little funding for the actual construction of such transmission lines. Most of the power and grid money made available under the law is broken into a diverse constellation of small programs, from carbon capture infrastructure to blackout prevention to nuclear energy.
A program to fund high-voltage power lines, the Transmission Facilitation Program, received just $2.5 billion and operates on a loan basis. "That's about one month's worth of transmission spending in the country," Gramlich said. "It's marginally helpful but a far cry from anything transformative."
The thirst for water
In addition to climate change, the infrastructure bill promised to address another pressing human and environmental priority: water.
The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. wastewater infrastructure a D-plus, with drinking water fairing only slightly better at a C-plus. A recent systemwide collapse that put more than 150,000 residents of Jackson, Mississippi, under a boil-water advisory highlighted the harm that can come from neglect.
The infrastructure bill promised to address such problems. It pumped about $50 billion into the water sector, about a fivefold increase over prior funding levels.
That's welcome news in cities such as El Paso, Texas, where a fresh infusion of $20 million from the bill will help pay for an advanced water recycling facility set to begin construction next year, bringing a sustainable water source to the drought-stricken city.
But advocates say that while funding in the bill is transformative for some such cities, the money will fall short across the entire country.
"I do wish people would stop calling it a once-in-a-generation bill," said Becky Hammer, deputy director of federal water policy at NRDC. "Because we need more investment this generation."
Erik Olson, a senior strategist at NRDC, said that spread over five years, new money in the bill for water infrastructure comes out to about $10 billion annually. That's a significant boost over regular funding levels, which average less than $3 billion. But with some estimates calling for more than $1 trillion to fully address the nation's water problems, that means it could still take centuries to clear a national backlog unless Congress continues to significantly increase funding.
As with money for transportation, the bill's water funding also flows through state agencies, which are subject to their own whims and often award money to politically connected and wealthy communities. Olson points to reporting around Jackson, which indicates state officials historically steered money away from the majority-Black city, to highlight the problem.
"Unless EPA and states can figure out a way around ... it's going to remain challenging to make sure this money goes to communities that need it most."

             The Environmental Protection Agency has opened a federal civil rights investigation into the state of Mississippi over the Jackson water crisis.
On Thursday, in response to complaints filed by the NAACP and Jackson residents, the EPA announced it will investigate whether the Mississippi Department of Health and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality "discriminated against the majority Black population of the City of Jackson on the basis of race in the funding of water infrastructure and treatment programs and activities," the announcement said.
An official with the US Environmental Protection Agency told CNN the two state agencies have acknowledged receiving the EPA's letter on the probe. The official said the investigation should wrap up within about four months.
An EPA spokesperson told CNN Friday should the EPA find wrongdoing, it has the power to withhold federal funds from the state of Mississippi but would be careful not to deprive Jackson of funds needed to ensure safe and reliable drinking water.
The spokesperson also said the EPA is prepared to refer the case to the US Department of Justice should the two state agencies fail to cooperate with the investigation.
The NAACP praised the EPA's action.
"Today's decision by the EPA is a significant first step in holding the state accountable for its role in exacerbating the Jackson water crisis," said NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Director Abre Conner. "For far too long, residents of Jackson, like Black communities across this country, have had water access weaponized against them."
The city of roughly 150,000 residents is 83% Black.
Neither the agencies nor the office of Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves have responded to CNN's request for comment since Thursday's announcement.
The water crisis got so bad for several months this year the National Guard was dispatched to help distribute bottled water around the city, which is Mississippi's capital.
Resident Virginia Evans told CNN recently the water problems have been so troubling she remains afraid to drink or cook with itdespite state officials lifting a more-than 40-day boil-water notice last month and declaring the water safe.
In the past six months, sometimes her toilets wouldn't flush or the water coming out the faucets at her home was brown and had low pressure, she said.
The city has long faced issues with its water system. Residents and activists point to years of systemic neglect as one of the main drivers. Some city leaders have blamed the state for not answering their calls for assistance with upgrading the decrepit water system.
According to the most recent data from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, the state's water crisis bill for the year has reached $12.6 million. Bottled water for distribution events accounts for about 25% of that amount.
The EPA has pressed the city for improvements for years, and in September, the US Justice Department, on behalf of the environmental agency, asked the city to "engage in immediate negotiations related to the City's recent drinking water crisis," according to a letter obtained by CNN affiliate WAPT. Officials from both agencies met with the mayor, the Justice Department told CNN last month in a statement.
It was no invitation for polite chitchat, as the highest law enforcement office in the land warned it was prepared to file a lawsuit under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which charges the EPA with setting and enforcing baseline health standards for tap water.

How AI could help translate extreme weather alerts

Oct 21, 2022( Axios: http://axios.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 A startup that provides AI-powered translation is working with the National Weather Service to improve language translations of extreme weather alerts across the U.S.  
The big picture: Gaps in language access to emergency alerts during extreme weather events have led to missed evacuations, injuries and loss of life for non-English speakers. Machine learning could mitigate that.  
Driving the news: AI-translation service Lilt has recently started working on a pilot project with the weather service to help produce more comprehensive weather warnings.  
How it works: Incorporating a mix of software and human translators, the service learns from linguists in real time using a neural network[1], or a computer system modeled loosely on the brain — which gets smarter with each use. The team behind Lilt, which earlier this year raised a $55 million[2] Series C, markets its speed of translation at the rate of at least three times the speed of other translation services, while also picking up slang and regional dialects. The software gets used by human forecasters at the NWS forecasting office, with the AI engine suggesting translation for the translators to work with, while actively storing all of their input. What they're saying: Phil Stiefel, solutions lead at Lilt, told Axios there is a longstanding need for better translation at the weather service. "If there's a translation error in a translated weather report, and somebody takes the wrong action based on that missed translation, then somebody could get hurt or even killed because of that," Stiefel told Axios. According to data[3] by the Migration Policy Institute, in 2019, 22% of U.S. residents over the age of five spoke a language other than English at home. The backstory: Past translation problems during floods, wildfires and tornadoes point to a legacy of language barriers within federal, state and local emergency weather alerting systems. In 2017, nearly all of the people in New York City to die from flash flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida were Asian and spoke limited English or Spanish, which the New York Times reported[4] may have led to those residents not receiving warnings to evacuate. Seven members of a Guatemalan family in Oklahoma died from flash floods in 2013 after leaving their home to seek shelter in a storm drain upon hearing a tornado warning. NBC News reported[5] "they hadn't heard or understood there had also been storm and flood warnings." And a 2020 study[6] found that emergency warnings during California's 2017-18 Thomas Fire were initially only available in English. As a result, Latino residents living in the two most heavily impacted counties missed information about evacuation areas, road closures, unsafe air and boil water notices. The intrigue: This isn't the only way the NWS is working to improve translation issues in the alert system. A 2021 research article[7] published in the American Meteorological Society looked at issues in English-to-Spanish translation of weather alerts that didn't account for dialects, which led to "inconsistent risk messaging," in Spanish-language alerts. The NWS/NOAA has since updated the language it uses in hazardous weather communication, adopting "dialect-neutral"[5] terminology suggested by the study authors, as reported by Noticias Telemundo. The bottom line: Monica Bozeman, the automated language translation lead at the NWS Office of Central Processing, told Axios in an email that the agency has developed experimental pilot projects looking to introduce automation to translation — Lilt being one of them. "From these projects, we hope to learn the feasibility of applying automation to gain efficiency with translation turnaround times while reducing the burden of translation on our personnel, especially during critical hazardous weather events," Bozeman wrote.

Highlight: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has launched a probe into whether Mississippi officials discriminated against the city of Jackson's majority Black population in its allocation of federal funds meant for drinking water, in response to a Title VI complaint filed by the NAACP.
Body




The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has launched a probe into whether Mississippi officials discriminated against the city of Jackson's majority Black population in its allocation of federal funds meant for drinking water, in response to a Title VI complaint filed by the NAACP.

 The EPA wrote a letter to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Thursday, announcing that it plans to investigate an administrative complaint filed by the civil rights group in late September, saying after careful consideration it determined that the claims against the Mississippi Department of Health and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality meet jurisdictional requirements.

 The EPA's Office of External Civil Rights Compliance, which resides within its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, rejected the NAACP's claims against the state's Department of Finance and Administration, however, saying it is not a recipient of EPA financial assistance.

 The other departments, MDH and MDEQ, met the agency's jurisdictional requirements for review in part because they receive federal funds from the EPA, the agency said.

 The NAACP launched its Title VI complaint against the three departments Sept. 27, alongside nine state residents, seeking an immediate investigation into their use of EPA funds related to Jackson's drinking water, as well as for the enactment of rapid enforcement remedies.

 In its complaint, the NAACP accused the departments of discriminating against the city's large Black population by diverting federal funds intended to ensure safe drinking water and unpolluted surface water and groundwater.

 "This discrimination is evident in the state's repeatedly having deprived Jackson of federal funds to maintain its public drinking water system in favor of funding smaller, majority-white communities with less acute needs," the NAACP said in its letter to the agency.

 As a result of this discrimination, the NAACP said the city has been plagued with "persistently unsafe and unreliable drinking water" and "massive gaps in the access to safe drinking water that are intolerable in any modern society."

 The organization said its complaint was prompted by Jackson's shutdown of its drinking water supply for many days in late August. When the water supply was restored, the NAACP said the city's water remained unsafe to drink, and under a boil-water notice, until Sept. 15.

 "Nearly all of the residents of Jackson have watched brackish, dirty, impure, and undrinkable water trickle from their taps," the NAACP said. "At times, some have had no water at all."

 This latest water shut-off is not a one-time occurrence, the NAACP said, but rather part of a series of incidents depriving Black residents of safe drinking water in large part due to the state's refusal to allocate adequate funds for Jackson to address its water system challenges.

 Furthermore, the NAACP accused the state of exacerbating the funding gap between what the city is allocated and what it needs by repeatedly denying Jackson the opportunity to fund improvements to its drinking water system and manage its debt.

 In its response, the EPA said it will specifically investigate whether the two Mississippi departments discriminated against Jackson's Black population in its funding of water infrastructure and treatment programs. Additionally, the agency said it will explore whether the departments are implementing required procedural safeguards, in compliance with their general nondiscrimination obligations.

 The EPA made sure to note in its response, however, that its initiation of the investigation into the complaint's claims is "not a decision on the merits."

 "[The Office of External Civil Rights Compliance] is a neutral fact finder and will begin its process to gather the relevant information, discuss the matter further with you and MDH and MDEQ, and determine next steps utilizing OECRC's internal procedures," the agency said.

 Jackson's recent water crisis has even gained congressional attention, when U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., sent a letter to Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves on Oct. 17 expressing concerns over the state's allocation of more than $10 billion in federal funds that were specifically allotted for improving the state's water infrastructure. The letter is part of a larger congressional investigation into the issue.

 MDH and MDEQ have been given a 30-day deadline to respond to the claims being investigated against them.

 The NAACP's Mississippi State Conference and the Mississippi Center for Justice also joined the NAACP in its complaint.

 Representatives for the EPA, the NAACP, and the three Mississippi departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.

EPA launches civil rights probe over Jackson water crisis

By Hannah Northey This story was updated at 2:15 p.m. EDT. EPA is opening a federal civil rights investigation into whether the Republican-led state of Mississippi violated the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against the majority-Black city of Jackson by blocking funding for a water treatment plant there that recently crashed. EPA on Thursday said it will take up a complaint lawyers representing the NAACP and a group of private residents filed last month, which accused state officials of starving Jackson of the funds needed to provide basic necessities like clean water (Greenwire , Sept. 28). Years of inadequate staffing, funding and maintenance backlogs have fueled system failures, regulatory concerns and hundreds of boil-water notices tied to the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant. 
In August, the plant was overwhelmed by floodwaters from the Pearl River, which ultimately triggered a dangerous drop in pressure that left more than 150,000 people without safe drinking water. Anhthu Hoang, acting head of EPA's Office of External Civil Rights Compliance, on Thursday told lawyers representing NAACP in a letter that the agency will investigate whether the Mississippi State Department of Health and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality discriminated against Jackson "on the basis of race in the funding of water infrastructure and treatment programs and activities." Hoang's letter was addressed to Janette McCarthy Wallace, NAACP's general counsel, and Carol Browner, ex-EPA chief under former President Bill Clinton and climate czar to former President Barack Obama, who is now a partner with the law firm Covington & Burling LLP, who had filed the complaint under Title 6 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The letter was also addressed to Gary Guzy, senior counsel at Covington. The law bars recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the base of race, color or national origin in programs or activities. "This discrimination is evident in the State's repeatedly having deprived Jackson of federal funds to maintain its public drinking water system in favor of funding smaller, majority-white communities with less acute needs - despite the fact that Jackson is Mississippi's most populous city, with a demonstrated need for improvements to water infrastructure," McCarthy Wallace and Browner and Guzy wrote in the complaint. Hoang said the NAACP's request met the jurisdictional requirements, but rejected allegations against the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration because the agency doesn't receive federal financial assistance. Specifically, EPA is investigating whether the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Mississippi State Department of Health discriminated against the city of Jackson on the "basis of race and color, by intent or effect" in funding water infrastructure and treatment programs and activities. Another focus of the investigation is whether the state agencies have or are implementing the "procedural safeguards" to comply with their general nondiscrimination obligations. The two state agencies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NAACP in a statement applauded EPA and the Biden administration for opening the federal civil rights investigation. "This action is only the first step. NAACP and its partners will continue to press the Biden Administration and Congress to hold state officials accountable and ensure that Jackson officials and residents are active participants in the decision-making that will be required to fix the unacceptable problems with Jackon's water," said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. Attorneys for the NAACP had argued that Mississippi officials, including Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, the Legislature, state treasurer and multiple agencies, repeatedly deprived the city of Jackson of necessary funding that met the populous city's needs. Reeves' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. State agencies, for example, awarded federal funds to the city through state revolving funds just three times in the past 25 years while channeling money to majority-white areas with less need, according to the complaint. The complaint also accused Reeves and the Republican-controlled state Legislature of taking other steps to block the city from helping itself, including vetoing legislation that would have provided Jackson with money to fix its water system, rejecting a sales tax to fund repairs there and appointing a state commission that hampered the city's expenditures. The O.B. Curtis water plant has long been on EPA's radar for lagging maintenance and staffing woes. The Department of Justice on behalf of EPA last month threatened to take legal action if the city of Jackson didn't enter into negotiations to address a series of outstanding violations under the Safe Drinking Water Act (Greenwire , Sept. 27). EPA's announcement arrives mere days after two congressional committees launched an investigation into the crisis (E&E News PM , Oct. 17).

EPA civil rights case targets Mississippi over Jackson water

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The federal government is investigating whether Mississippi state agencies discriminated against the state's majority-Black capital city by refusing to fund improvements for its failing water system, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.
The announcement came days after leaders of two congressional committees said they were starting a joint investigation into a crisis that left most homes and businesses in Jackson without running water for several days in late August and early September.
The EPA gave The Associated Press the first confirmation that it is conducting a civil, not criminal, investigation of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Mississippi State Department of Health. The federal agency could withhold money from the state if it finds wrongdoing — potentially millions of dollars. If the state agencies don’t cooperate with the investigation, the EPA could refer the case to the Department of Justice.
Heavy rainfall in late August exacerbated problems at Jackson's main water treatment facility. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves declared an emergency Aug. 29, and the state health department and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency have been overseeing operations and repairs at the facility since then.
About 80% of Jackson’s 150,000 residents are Black, and about a quarter of the population lives in poverty. By the time Reeves issued the emergency order, Jackson residents had already been told for a month to boil their water to kill possible contaminants. Volunteers and the National Guard had distributed millions of bottles of drinking water. Although the boil-water notice was lifted in mid-September, many residents remain skeptical about water safety.
NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who lives in Jackson with his family, called the EPA investigation a step in the right direction after years of the state withholding federal funds needed to improve the city’s water system.
“We believe we gave compelling evidence that the state of Mississippi intentionally starved the city of Jackson of the resources to maintain its water infrastructure,” Johnson told The AP on Thursday. “We want the EPA and this administration to put forth a course of action to prevent the state of Mississippi from ever doing this again.”
Johnson was named among several residents in the NAACP’s civil rights complaint against Mississippi. He said the state’s inaction and record of divestment in Jackson amounts to “systemic neglect.”
“We believe that all citizens of this country should be entitled to clean, fresh drinking water,” Johnson said. “Unfortunately, we live in a state that is still dealing in racial politics. And as a result of that, you have state leaders who seek to penalize African American residents of the city of Jackson in a very discriminatory way.”
The AP reported in September that years before Reeves became governor, he touted his own track record of fiscal conservatism by citing his opposition to spending state money for Jackson's crumbling water and sewer infrastructure. The EPA is not investigating Reeves.
Reeves said Thursday that the state took control of Jackson’s water system because of “absolute and total incompetence” of the city's Democratic mayor and administration. The governor’s latest remarks are an escalation of a dispute between him and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba over whether the state or the city will decide on a private firm to operate Jackson’s water system.
“They have proven that they have no ability to manage the water system,” Reeves told reporters during an event at the Governor’s Mansion, according to a video of the event by WLBT-TV.
Melissa Payne, a city spokesperson, said Lumumba would not respond to the governor's statements.
In a federal complaint Sept. 27, the NAACP said Mississippi officials “all but assured” a drinking water calamity by depriving Jackson of badly needed funds to upgrade its infrastructure. The organization asked the EPA to investigate the state’s alleged pattern of steering money to majority-white communities with less need.
The group said the state’s refusal to fund improvements in Jackson culminated in the near-total collapse of the water system in late August. Over 25 years, Jackson received funds from an important federal program only three times, the NAACP said. When Jackson tried to fund improvements itself, those efforts were repeatedly blocked by state political leaders, according to the complaint.
The NAACP wants the EPA to make sure that from now on, federal funds are distributed equitably.
Reeves said Thursday that the state has bought chemicals and hired workers for the water plant since he declared the emergency, after the city failed to do both of those things.
The NAACP filed its complaint under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids recipients of federal funds from discriminating based on race or national origin. While previously the law was rarely used to pursue environmental matters, the Biden administration has increased its enforcement efforts in communities overburdened by pollution.
Recently, the EPA said it had preliminary evidence that Louisiana officials allowed air pollution to remain high and downplayed the threat to Black residents who live in the industrial section of the state commonly referred to as cancer alley. The agency has also opened up an investigation into Colorado’s air permitting program and into state and local officials in Alabama over chronic wastewater problems in majority-Black Lowndes County.
